# Rotki - Project Overview

Rotki is an open-source, self-hosted portfolio management tool that puts privacy first. Unlike most competitors which are closed-source SaaS platforms requiring users to hand over sensitive financial data, Rotki keeps data encrypted and stored locally—ensuring users stay in control. The application provides comprehensive portfolio tracking across multiple blockchains and exchanges, transaction decoding, analytics, accounting, and tax reporting capabilities. It supports 80+ DeFi protocols and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
