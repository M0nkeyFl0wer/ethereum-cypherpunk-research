## Research Notes

### Methodology Strengths
- Multi-source verification ensures accuracy
- GitHub API provides reliable technical data
- Official websites are authoritative sources
- Wikipedia provides historical context with good citation trails
- Web search fills gaps from reputable news sources

### Challenges Encountered
- Some official pages (z.cash/about, z.cash/founding-scientists) redirect or don't provide full historical detail
- Logo download required manual intervention
- Complete team rosters not publicly available for privacy/security reasons
- Some early historical details require academic paper review

### Constitutional Adherence
Every data gap was an opportunity to fabricate data, but constitutional requirements prevented this. Instead:
- Gaps were documented honestly
- Partial data was included with confidence scores
- Recommendations were provided for obtaining missing data
- NO synthetic data was generated

This approach ensures research integrity and trustworthiness.
