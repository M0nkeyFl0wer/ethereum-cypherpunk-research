# Chainport

ChainPort is a next-generation security-focused cross-chain bridge that enables users to port tokens across 25+ blockchain ecosystems with fast, permissionless transfers. It is the first bridge that offers a fully security-focused solution safeguarding 95% of funds in cold storage vaults, using active multi-party computation (MPC) with hardware isolation powered by Fireblocks. ChainPort is the only bridge that supports all common bridging methods including wrapped asset bridging (lock-and-mint), native token bridging, hybrid bridging, and external cross-chain protocols like Circle's CCTP for USDC. The platform enables full interoperability, allowing users to port tokens across multiple blockchains without needing to revert back to the original chain.
