    "description": "ZKP2P is the first trustless P2P on/offramping bulletin board. It enables a new buying and selling crypto experience that is fast, cheap and composable with DeFi. Currently, the only way to buy and sell crypto is through centralized exchanges or custodians, which are expensive, slow, and require unnecessarily intrusive identity verification. Using cryptographic proofs of transfer, ZKP2P allows buyers to authenticate that they have transferred the correct value to sellers. Buyers instantly receive their crypto in less than 60 seconds with settlement facilitated by fully noncustodial smart contracts.",
