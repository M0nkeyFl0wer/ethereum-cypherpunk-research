# Zksync

zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) to enhance transaction throughput while maintaining security, decentralization, and privacy. It provides institutional-grade security with user-level privacy using selective disclosure and onchain cryptographic proofs. Individual transaction details remain hidden within ZK proofs, offering superior privacy compared to Optimistic Rollups. zkSync achieves low costs (~$0.0001/transfer) with real-time UX through Airbender high-frequency proving.
