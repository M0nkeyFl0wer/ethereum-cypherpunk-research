# Project Metadata - starknet

**Name**: Starknet

**Category**: Uncategorized

**Description**: Starknet is a Validity-Rollup (ZK-Rollup) Layer 2 network operating on Ethereum that uses STARK proofs to achieve massive scalability without compromising security. Powered by the Cairo programming language optimized for STARK-based computation, Starknet bundles transactions into off-chain computed STARK proofs submitted to Ethereum as single transactions. In 2025, Starknet became Bitcoin's execution layer, settling on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, processing 10,000+ TPS with quantum-resistant cryptography. The network enables complex applications with significantly lower costs and faster processing than Layer 1, supporting thousands of transactions per second.
