  "project_description": "Railway Wallet is a private DeFi wallet powered by RAILGUN's zkSNARK privacy system, enabling completely untraceable ERC-20 token transactions across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, and additional chains. The wallet allows users to shield tokens for transaction privacy, interact with public DeFi platforms (swaps, yield, liquidity) from private 0zk addresses, and maintains local-only encrypted storage with zero activity logging. Compliance features include Viewing Keys, Private Proofs of Innocence (Privacy Pools), and tax reporting, available on desktop, iOS, and Android platforms.",
