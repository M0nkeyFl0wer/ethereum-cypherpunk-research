## Data Gaps Identified

### ⚠️ Intentional Privacy (Not Data Gaps)
The following are **NOT gaps** but **intentional design choices**:
- Many developers remain pseudonymous/anonymous (privacy culture)
- Core Team disbanded (governance evolution to workgroups)
- Founder "thankful_for_today" was pseudonymous (intentional)

### ℹ️ Minor Unverified Items
1. **Consensus Mechanism**: "Proof of Work (RandomX)" - confidence 0.95
   - Common knowledge but not explicitly stated in collected primary sources
   - Recommendation: Verify from technical documentation

### ✅ No Smart Contracts
- Monero is a native blockchain, **not a smart contract platform**
- This is accurately reported as N/A (not a gap)

---

## Verification Methodology

### Multi-Source Cross-Verification
Each critical data point verified across **2-4 independent sources**:

**Example: Founding Information**
- Source 1: getmonero.org/resources/about/
- Source 2: GitHub repository README
- Source 3: Historical announcements
- **Confidence**: 1.0 (fully verified)

**Example: Market Data**
- Source 1: CoinGecko API (real-time)
- Source 2: Web3Privacy Explorer
- **Confidence**: 1.0 (API data)

### Confidence Scoring System
- **1.0**: Directly verified from primary official source
- **0.95**: Strong secondary evidence from reputable source
- **0.9**: Multiple secondary sources corroborate
- **<0.9**: Limited verification, flagged for review
