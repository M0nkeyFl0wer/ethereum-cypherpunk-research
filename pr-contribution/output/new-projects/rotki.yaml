  Rotki is an open-source, self-hosted portfolio management tool that puts privacy first. Unlike
  most competitors which are closed-source SaaS platforms requiring users to hand over sensitive
  financial data, Rotki keeps data encrypted and stored locally—ensuring users stay in control. The
  application provides comprehensive portfolio tracking across multiple blockchains and exchanges,
  transaction decoding, analytics, accounting, and tax reporting capabilities. It supports 80+ DeFi
  protocols and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
