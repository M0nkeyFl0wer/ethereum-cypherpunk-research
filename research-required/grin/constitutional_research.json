    "description": "Grin is an in-progress implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol. Mimblewimble is a blockchain format and protocol that provides extremely good scalability, privacy and fungibility by relying on strong cryptographic primitives. It addresses gaps existing in almost all current blockchain implementations. Grin provides privacy by default, enabling complete fungibility without precluding the ability to selectively disclose information as needed. It scales mostly with the number of users and minimally with the number of transactions, resulting in large space savings compared to other blockchains.",
