# Umbra Cash

## 📝 Description
Privacy-preserving stealth payments on EVM blockchain networks. Enables transactions where the receiver's identity is known only to the sender and receiver, using stealth addresses that have never been seen on-chain before. Not a mixer - relies on elliptic curve cryptography rather than zero-knowledge proofs.
