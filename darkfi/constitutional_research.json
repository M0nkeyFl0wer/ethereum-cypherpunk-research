  "description": "DarkFi is a multichain layer-1 protocol for anonymous applications and smart contracts powered by zero-knowledge proofs. It's an L1 for anonymous engineering that uses advances in zero-knowledge cryptography and includes a contracting language and developer toolkits to create uncensorable code. DarkFi seeks to develop applications with smart contracts beyond being a money system, creating user-empowering systems that preserve fundamental human rights like privacy and freedom of speech.",
