## Infrastructure Overview

### Domain Ecosystem

| Domain | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **nym.com** | Main website | Active |
| **nymtech.net** | Legacy domain | Redirects to nym.com |
| **nymvpn.com** | VPN product | Active |
| **nymte.ch** | Infrastructure | Active |
| **nyx.network** | Network services | Active |

### DNS Configuration

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| DNS Provider | Gandi |
| Nameservers | ns-48-a.gandi.net, ns-230-c.gandi.net, ns-106-b.gandi.net |

### IP Infrastructure

| Service | IP | Provider |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Main Website | 76.76.21.22 | Vercel |
| VPN Website | 76.76.21.21 | Vercel |
| Infrastructure | 217.70.184.55 | OVH/Gandi |

---

## Shodan Analysis

### Main Website (76.76.21.22)

```json
{
  "ip": "76.76.21.22",
  "ports": [80, 443],
  "cpes": [],
  "tags": [],
  "vulns": []
}
```

**Assessment:** CLEAN - Minimal exposure with only standard web ports.

## Security Headers Analysis

### nym.com - EXCELLENT

| Header | Value | Grade |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Strict-Transport-Security** | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains | A+ |
| **Content-Security-Policy** | Comprehensive with frame-ancestors 'none' | A+ |
| **X-Content-Type-Options** | nosniff | A |
| **X-Frame-Options** | SAMEORIGIN | A |
| **Referrer-Policy** | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | A |
| **Permissions-Policy** | geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=() | A |

### CSP Highlights

```
default-src 'self';
frame-ancestors 'none';
upgrade-insecure-requests;
```

- **Strict default-src** - Only allows same-origin resources
- **frame-ancestors 'none'** - Prevents clickjacking
- **upgrade-insecure-requests** - Forces HTTPS

## Subdomain Analysis

### Discovered Services (12 subdomains)

| Subdomain | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| nym.com | Main website |
| www.nym.com | WWW alias |
| assets.nym.com | Static assets |
| bridge.nym.com | Token bridge |
| forms.nym.com | Form handling |
| forum.nym.com | Community forum |
| governator.nym.com | Governance system |
| node-status.nym.com | Node monitoring |
| stats.nym.com | Network statistics |
| support.nym.com | Support portal |
| swapper.nym.com | Token swapping |
| **zcash-swapper.nym.com** | Zcash integration |

### Notable: Zcash Integration

The presence of `zcash-swapper.nym.com` indicates NYM has integration with Zcash for private token swapping, combining mixnet anonymity with Zcash's shielded transactions.

## Third-Party Integrations

From CSP analysis:

| Service | Domain | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Exoscale (Swiss) | strapi-www-nym-com.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io | CMS hosting |
| BTCPay Server | btcpay.nymte.ch | Bitcoin payments |
| Spectre DAO | api.nym.spectredao.net | DAO integration |
| Stripe | js.stripe.com | Fiat payments |
| Vercel | vercel.live, *.vercel.app | Hosting/CDN |

**Swiss Hosting Note:** Using Exoscale (sos-ch-dk-2) for CMS data indicates commitment to privacy-respecting jurisdictions.

## Privacy Architecture Assessment

### Mixnet Design

```
[Client] → [Gateway] → [Mix1] → [Mix2] → [Mix3] → [Gateway] → [Destination]
              ↑                                        ↑
         Entry point                              Exit point
              └──── Sphinx packets + cover traffic ────┘
```

### Privacy Guarantees

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Sphinx Packets | ✅ | Unlinkable encryption layers |
| Cover Traffic | ✅ | Masks real communication patterns |
| Coconut Credentials | ✅ | Anonymous service access |
| Timing Obfuscation | ✅ | Random delays in mix nodes |
| Economic Incentives | ✅ | NYM token staking |

### Comparison to Tor

| Aspect | NYM | Tor |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Cover traffic | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Timing obfuscation | ✅ Strong | ⚠️ Limited |
| Economic model | Token-based | Volunteer |
| Latency | Higher | Lower |
| Academic basis | Loopix | Onion routing |

## Risk Assessment

### Security Posture

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure Security | ✅ **EXCELLENT** | No CVEs, minimal port exposure |
| Security Headers | ✅ **EXCELLENT** | HSTS, CSP, all major headers |
| Transparency | ✅ **EXCELLENT** | 57 public repos |
| Privacy Architecture | ✅ **EXCELLENT** | Academic-grade mixnet design |
| Third-Party Risk | ✅ **GOOD** | Swiss hosting, reputable providers |

### Positive Findings

1. **Zero CVEs detected** on infrastructure
2. **Comprehensive CSP** with strict default-src
3. **HSTS enabled** with includeSubDomains
4. **57 public repositories** - high transparency
5. **Swiss hosting** for sensitive services (Exoscale)
6. **Multi-cloud architecture** reduces single points of failure
7. **Zcash integration** for enhanced privacy options
8. **Academic foundation** (Loopix research)

### Areas to Monitor

1. **Mixnet node security** - Distributed infrastructure is harder to audit
2. **Cosmos validator security** - nyxd requires ongoing monitoring
3. **Third-party dependencies** - Spectre DAO, BTCPay integrations

---

## Recommendations

### For NYM Team (Minor)

1. Consider publishing infrastructure security audit results
2. Document mixnet node operational security requirements
3. Add security.txt file for vulnerability disclosure

### For Users

1. **Use NymVPN** for consumer-ready mixnet access
2. **Verify node selection** for sensitive use cases
3. **Understand latency trade-offs** - not suitable for real-time applications
4. **Consider Zcash swapper** for additional transaction privacy
