## Team Philosophy

DarkFi's team operates with a crypto-anarchist philosophy rooted in:

1. **Privacy as a Design Space**: Treating anonymity as a fundamental design principle
2. **Lunarpunk Movement**: Emphasizing privacy, autonomy, and resistance to surveillance
3. **Rojava Influence**: Both Taaki and O'Leary have experience with the Rojava revolution
4. **Cypherpunk Heritage**: Continuing the tradition of cryptographic privacy tools

The project's `IDEOLOGY.md` file contains philosophical writings from Abdullah Ocalan's "The Sociology of Freedom: Manifesto of the Democratic Civilization," indicating the project's grounding in democratic confederalism and radical political theory.

---

## Team Structure

**Privacy-Focused Organization**: As a privacy-centric project, DarkFi intentionally limits public disclosure of team members. The core team communicates primarily through:

- DarkIRC (their own P2P anonymous IRC)
- Twitter [@DarkFiSquad](https://twitter.com/DarkFiSquad)
- In-person at privacy-focused conferences

**Development Model**: Open source with AGPL-3.0 license, encouraging community contributions while maintaining strong copyleft protections.
