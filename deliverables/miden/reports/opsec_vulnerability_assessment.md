## Cloud Infrastructure Analysis

### AWS eu-north-1 (Stockholm)

All backend services are deployed on AWS in the Stockholm region using Application Load Balancers:

| Service | ALB Hostname | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| RPC | rpc-lb-testnet-174389996.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com | JSON-RPC endpoint |
| Faucet | faucet-lb-testnet-1421763297.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com | Token distribution |
| Prover | prover-backend-testnet-alb-1224313206.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com | ZK proof generation |
| Monitor | monitor-lb-testnet-764180457.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com | Status monitoring |

**Observed IPs:**
- `13.62.146.108` (AWS EC2 eu-north-1)
- `13.48.115.192` (AWS EC2 eu-north-1)

### GitHub Pages (Fastly CDN)

| Subdomain | CNAME Target | CDN |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| playground.miden.io | 0xmiden.github.io | Fastly |

**GitHub Pages IPs:**
- 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153

## Shodan Analysis

### RPC Testnet Endpoint (13.62.146.108)

```json
{
  "ports": [443],
  "tags": ["cloud"],
  "vulnerabilities": [],
  "cpes": []
}
```

**Assessment:** Clean scan - HTTPS only, no unnecessary ports exposed, no known vulnerabilities.

### GitHub Pages Infrastructure

```json
{
  "ports": [80, 443],
  "cpes": ["cpe:/a:varnish-software:varnish_cache", "cpe:/a:fastly:fastly"],
  "vulnerabilities": []
}
```

**Assessment:** Standard GitHub Pages/Fastly setup with Varnish caching.

## Security Headers Analysis

### playground.miden.io

| Header | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Server | GitHub.com | ✅ |
| Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=31556952 | ✅ Enabled |
| X-Cache | Fastly CDN | ✅ |

**Missing Headers (Recommendations):**
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Permissions-Policy
- Referrer-Policy

---

## Risk Assessment

### Centralization Concerns

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Single cloud provider (AWS) | Medium | All infra in eu-north-1 |
| Single DNS provider (Route53) | Low | Standard for AWS deployments |
| GitHub Pages dependency | Low | Only for static playground |

### Positive Security Findings

- ✅ No known vulnerabilities detected via Shodan
- ✅ HTTPS enforced on all endpoints
- ✅ HSTS enabled on accessible endpoints
- ✅ Proper environment separation (devnet/testnet)
- ✅ AWS infrastructure properly tagged as "cloud"
- ✅ No unnecessary ports exposed (443 only on backend)

### Attack Surface Summary

| Vector | Exposure | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Open Ports | Minimal | Only 443 (HTTPS) exposed |
| Service Fingerprinting | Low | AWS/GitHub Pages standard configs |
| DNS Zone Transfer | Protected | No zone transfer vulnerabilities |
| Subdomain Takeover | Low Risk | All subdomains actively resolve |

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Add Content-Security-Policy** - Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
2. **Multi-region deployment** - Consider backup region for production launch

### Medium Priority

3. **Security headers hardening** - Add X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
4. **Certificate monitoring** - Set up alerts for certificate transparency logs

### Low Priority

5. **DDoS protection** - Consider CloudFlare or AWS Shield for production
6. **Rate limiting** - Implement on RPC and faucet endpoints
