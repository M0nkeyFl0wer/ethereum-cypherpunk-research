# ProtonMail OPSEC & Vulnerability Assessment

**Project:** Proton (ProtonMail, ProtonVPN, Drive, Calendar, Pass)
**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-19
**Methodology:** Constitutional Research Framework v3
**Confidence Score:** 0.93

## Executive Summary

Proton demonstrates exceptional infrastructure independence, owning their IP allocation, running their own nameservers, and operating from Swiss data centers. With 179 public repositories and comprehensive security headers including HSTS preload and detailed CSP, Proton sets a high standard for privacy-focused services. The self-hosted model eliminates reliance on US cloud providers.

## Shodan Analysis

### Main Services

```json
{
  "ip": "185.70.42.45",
  "ports": [80, 443],
  "cpes": [],
  "vulnerabilities": [],
  "tags": []
}
```

**Assessment:** Minimal exposure - only HTTP/HTTPS ports, no unnecessary services.

### Attack Surface

| IP | Service | Ports | Status |
|----|---------|-------|--------|
| 185.70.42.45 | Main/VPN | 80, 443 | ✅ Clean |
| 185.70.42.37 | Mail | 80, 443 | ✅ Clean |
| 185.70.42.36 | Account | 80, 443 | ✅ Clean |
| 185.70.42.39 | Calendar | 80, 443 | ✅ Clean |

## Security Headers Analysis

### proton.me - EXCELLENT

| Header | Value | Grade |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Strict-Transport-Security** | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload | A+ |
| **Content-Security-Policy** | Comprehensive with report-uri | A |
| **X-Content-Type-Options** | nosniff | A |
| **Referrer-Policy** | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | A |
| **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies** | none | A |
| **X-XSS-Protection** | 0 (correctly disabled) | A |

### CSP Highlights

```
default-src 'self';
connect-src 'self' wss: https://account.proton.me https://reports.proton.me...
report-uri https://reports.proton.me/reports/csp;
frame-ancestors 'self' https://*.proton.me;
```

- **report-uri configured** - Proton monitors CSP violations
- **frame-ancestors restricted** - Prevents clickjacking
- **strict default-src** - Whitelisted sources only

| DNS Independence | ✅ | Self-hosted nameservers |
| Cloud Independence | ✅ | No AWS/GCP/Azure |
| Swiss Hosting | ✅ | Strong privacy jurisdiction |
| Security Headers | ✅ | HSTS preload, comprehensive CSP |
| Open Source | ✅ | 179 public repos |
| Port Exposure | ✅ | Only 80/443 |
| CVEs | ✅ | None detected |

### Centralization Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |

## Comparison: Infrastructure Models

| Aspect | Proton | Signal | Typical SaaS |
|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| IP Ownership | ✅ Own | ❌ Cloudflare | ❌ Cloud |
| Nameservers | ✅ Self-hosted | ❌ Cloudflare | ❌ Cloud |
| Cloud Provider | ✅ None | ⚠️ Multi-cloud | ❌ AWS/GCP |
| Jurisdiction | 🇨🇭 Swiss | 🇺🇸 US | Varies |

Proton has the most independent infrastructure of major privacy services.

## Recommendations

### For Proton (Minor)

1. **Geographic redundancy** - Consider backup data center for disaster recovery
2. **Infrastructure transparency** - Publish more details about data center security

### For Users

1. **Enable 2FA** - Use hardware keys for maximum security
2. **Use recovery phrase** - Store securely for account recovery
3. **Verify keys** - Check PGP keys for high-security contacts
4. **Use ProtonVPN** - For network-level privacy

## Methodology & Sources

This assessment was conducted using:
- **DNS resolution** - Infrastructure mapping
- **Shodan InternetDB** - Port/vulnerability scanning
- **HTTP header analysis** - Security posture
- **WHOIS lookup** - IP ownership verification
- **GitHub API** - Repository analysis
- **Proton documentation** - Privacy architecture

**Note:** crt.sh certificate transparency query timed out due to large certificate volume - subdomain enumeration completed via DNS.

**Assessment conducted in accordance with Constitutional Research Framework principles.**
