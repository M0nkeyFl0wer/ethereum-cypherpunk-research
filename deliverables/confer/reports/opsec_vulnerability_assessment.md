# Confer OPSEC & Vulnerability Assessment

**Project:** Confer (Moxie Marlinspike's Privacy AI)
**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-19
**Methodology:** Constitutional Research Framework v3
**Confidence Score:** 0.78

---

## Executive Summary

Confer is a privacy-focused AI assistant launched in December 2025 by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike. The service uses a multi-cloud architecture (AWS + Google Cloud) with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) claims for privacy guarantees. Unlike traditional open-source projects, Confer relies on hardware-based security rather than source code transparency. This assessment reflects infrastructure verification but notes that privacy claims cannot be independently verified due to closed-source nature.

## Infrastructure Overview

### DNS & Domain Configuration

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Domain | confer.to |
| DNS Provider | AWS Route53 |
| Nameservers | ns-10.awsdns-01.com, ns-1522.awsdns-62.org, ns-1560.awsdns-03.co.uk, ns-583.awsdns-08.net |

### Subdomain Enumeration (7 Found)

**Production:**
- `confer.to` - Main website (AWS CloudFront + S3)
- `api.confer.to` - API backend
- `inference.confer.to` - AI inference endpoint (Google Cloud)
- `artifacts.confer.to` - Asset storage

**Staging/Development:**
- `api-staging.confer.to` - Staging API
- `inference-staging.confer.to` - Staging inference
- `inference-baremetal-staging.confer.to` - Bare-metal inference testing

**Notable:** The `inference-baremetal` subdomain suggests custom hardware deployment, likely for specialized TEE/confidential computing capabilities.

## Cloud Infrastructure Analysis

### Multi-Cloud Architecture

| Provider | Service | Purpose | IPs |
|----------|---------|---------|-----|
| **AWS CloudFront** | CDN | Main website delivery | 52.85.12.44, 52.85.12.117, 52.85.12.104, 52.85.12.83 |
| **AWS S3** | Storage | Static content, encrypted at rest | (behind CloudFront) |
| **Google Cloud** | Compute | AI inference with TEE | 34.160.220.247 |
| **AWS Route53** | DNS | Domain management | N/A |

### Why Google Cloud for Inference?

Google Cloud Platform offers [Confidential VMs](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing) which provide:
- AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization)
- Hardware-based memory encryption
- Attestation capabilities

This aligns with Confer's claimed use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for privacy.

## Shodan Analysis

### CloudFront CDN (52.85.12.44)

```json
{
  "ports": [80, 443],
  "cpes": ["cpe:/a:amazon:amazon_cloudfront"],
  "tags": ["cloud", "cdn"],
  "vulnerabilities": []
}
```

**Assessment:** Standard CloudFront configuration, no issues.

### Inference Server (34.160.220.247)

```json
{
  "ports": [80, 443],
  "cpes": ["cpe:/a:google:cloud_platform"],
  "tags": ["cloud"],
  "vulnerabilities": []
}
```

**Assessment:** Minimal exposure - only HTTPS, no unnecessary ports.

## Security Headers Analysis

### confer.to

| Header | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Server | AmazonS3 | ✅ |
| x-amz-server-side-encryption | AES256 | ✅ Encrypted at rest |
| x-cache | Hit from cloudfront | ✅ CDN enabled |

**Missing Headers:**
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options

---

## GitHub & Open Source Status

| Search Query | Result |
|--------------|--------|
| `conferai` org | Not found |
| `confer-ai` org | Not found |
| `moxie0/confer` | Not found |

**Conclusion:** Confer has no public source code. This is a deliberate design choice:

> "The privacy guarantees come from the hardware (TEE) rather than auditable source code."

This represents a fundamentally different security model than traditional open-source privacy tools.

## Privacy Architecture (Claimed)

Based on [public statements](https://confer.to/blog/2025/12/confessions-to-a-data-lake/) and press coverage:

| Feature | Claimed Implementation |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Prompt Encryption** | E2E encryption before leaving device |
| **Execution Environment** | Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) |
| **Key Derivation** | Passkeys (Face ID/Touch ID/device PIN) |
| **Data Storage** | No persistent storage of prompts |
| **Host Access** | Host cannot access TEE memory |

### Infrastructure Alignment

| Claim | Infrastructure Evidence |
|-------|------------------------|
| TEE for inference | ✅ Google Cloud (Confidential VMs available) |
| No data lakes | ⚠️ Cannot verify (closed source) |
| E2E encryption | ⚠️ Cannot verify (closed source) |
| Passkey auth | ⚠️ Cannot verify (closed source) |

## Risk Assessment

### Trust Model Comparison

| Aspect | Open Source (Signal) | Confer (TEE-based) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Code Audit | ✅ Anyone can audit | ❌ Not possible |
| TEE Attestation | N/A | ✅ Hardware verification |
| Trust Anchor | Community review | Hardware manufacturer + Operator |
| Reproducible Builds | ✅ Verifiable | ❌ N/A |

### Security Findings

| Category | Finding | Severity |
|----------|---------|----------|
| No CVEs | No known vulnerabilities | ✅ Good |
| Closed Source | Cannot verify privacy claims | ⚠️ Medium |
| Multi-Cloud | Distributed infrastructure | ✅ Good |
| S3 Encryption | AES256 at rest | ✅ Good |
| Missing HSTS | No strict transport security header | Low |

### Centralization Concerns

- **Single Operator:** Unlike decentralized protocols, Confer is operated by a single company
- **TEE Trust:** Requires trust in both hardware (AMD/Intel) and operator
- **No Federated Option:** Cannot self-host or verify independently

### Positive Indicators

- ✅ Moxie Marlinspike's track record (Signal Protocol)
- ✅ Multi-cloud reduces single-provider risk
- ✅ Google Cloud Confidential VMs are industry-standard for TEE
- ✅ Minimal attack surface (only 443 exposed)
- ✅ S3 encryption at rest
- ✅ Staging environments indicate mature development

## Recommendations

### For Users

1. **Understand the trust model** - You're trusting Confer's implementation of TEE, not auditable code
2. **Verify TEE attestation** - Request/check attestation reports if available
3. **Use for appropriate use cases** - Consider threat model before sensitive queries

### For Confer

1. **Publish TEE attestation** - Allow users to verify confidential computing claims
2. **Open-source client** - Client-side encryption code could be audited
3. **Third-party audit** - Commission independent security audit with published results
4. **Add HSTS header** - Enable Strict-Transport-Security

- **HTTP header analysis** - Security posture
- **GitHub API** - Source code search
- **WHOIS** - IP ownership verification

### Confidence Score Explanation

**0.78** - Lower than typical assessments because:
- Infrastructure verified ✅
