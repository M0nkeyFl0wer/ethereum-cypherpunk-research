# Bitchat OPSEC & Vulnerability Assessment

**Project:** Bitchat
**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-22
**Methodology:** Constitutional Research Framework v3
**Confidence Score:** 0.90

---

## Executive Summary

Bitchat is a novel P2P messaging app using BLE mesh networking with Nostr fallback. While the architecture minimizes server-side attack surface, **critical application-layer vulnerabilities** were publicly disclosed in July 2025. The creator (Jack Dorsey) acknowledged these issues and added security disclaimers, but fixes remain in progress.

**Overall Risk Rating: HIGH** (for users requiring security guarantees)

## Critical Findings

| Finding | Severity | Status | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Identity Authentication Bypass | CRITICAL | In Progress | Attacker can impersonate any contact |
| Insufficient Forward Secrecy | HIGH | Acknowledged | Session key compromise exposes all session messages |
| Master Key Single Point of Failure | HIGH | Design Limitation | Total permanent compromise if key leaked |
| Buffer Overflow | MEDIUM | PATCHED | Memory corruption (fixed in 4 hours) |

## Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Identity Authentication Bypass (CRITICAL)

**Discovered by:** Alex Radocea (July 2025)

**Technical Description:**
```
The ephemeral keys aren't properly verified. In fact, they aren't
verified by a user's identity key at all!

The attack: send a private message to another user, present the
public key of whoever you're trying to impersonate, and include
new ephemeral encryption keys.

Even if your target has this remote user marked as a favorite,
the new encryption keys are trusted.
```

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker intercepts communication path
2. Attacker presents victim's public key to target
3. Attacker provides own ephemeral keys
4. Target believes they're talking to victim
5. Attacker reads/modifies all messages

**Remediation Status:**
- Dorsey committed to migrating to Noise Protocol Framework
- QR code / fingerprint verification being added
- No timeline for completion

### 2. Insufficient Forward Secrecy (HIGH)

**Technical Description:**
Forward secrecy is implemented at session level only, with static encryption keys per session. Industry standard (Signal Protocol / Double Ratchet) provides per-message forward secrecy.

**Impact:**
- Compromise of one session key exposes ALL messages in that session
- Unlike Signal, there's no continuous key rotation
- Historical messages vulnerable if keys are later compromised

**Comparison:**
| App | Forward Secrecy Level |
|-----|----------------------|
| Signal | Per-message (Double Ratchet) |
| WhatsApp | Per-message (Double Ratchet) |
| Bitchat | Per-session (static keys) |

### 3. Master Key Single Point of Failure (HIGH)

**Technical Description:**
User identity is tied to a single master private key stored on device.

**Impact:**
- Malware stealing master key = total, permanent compromise
- No key rotation mechanism
- No recovery mechanism
- "A single piece of malware could harvest master private keys from thousands of users"

### 4. Buffer Overflow (PATCHED)

**Status:** Fixed within 4 hours of disclosure
**Note:** Rapid response is a positive indicator of security posture

## Infrastructure Analysis

### Attack Surface Assessment

Bitchat has **minimal server infrastructure** by design:

**What Bitchat DOESN'T operate:**
- Authentication servers
- Message relay servers
- User databases
- API endpoints

**What they DO operate:**
- GitHub repository
- App Store listing
- (Possibly) bitchat.io domain (unverified if official)

### Domain Scan Results

| Domain | IP | Hosting | Notes |
|--------|-----|---------|-------|
| bitchat.free | 185.199.x.x | GitHub Pages | Official site |
| bitchat.io | 185.53.179.128 | Unknown | Not official |
| bitchat.app | 0.0.0.0 | N/A | Parked/unused |

**Assessment:** Infrastructure attack surface is minimal. Official site is on GitHub Pages (no custom server). Primary risks are in the application layer, not server infrastructure.

## Recommendations

### For Users

**DO NOT USE if:**
- You are a journalist protecting sources
- You are an activist in a hostile state
- You need verified identity of contacts
- Message confidentiality is critical

**ACCEPTABLE for:**
- Casual communication
- Experimentation with mesh networking
- Situations where availability > confidentiality
- Backup communication during network outages

### For the Bitchat Team

1. **Priority 1:** Complete Noise Protocol migration with proper identity verification
2. **Priority 2:** Implement Double Ratchet or similar for per-message forward secrecy
3. **Priority 3:** Commission external security audit (Trail of Bits, NCC Group, etc.)
4. **Priority 4:** Add key rotation mechanism
