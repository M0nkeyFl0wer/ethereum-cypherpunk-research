# Secret Network OPSEC & Vulnerability Assessment

**Project:** Secret Network (SCRT)
**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-20
**Methodology:** Constitutional Research Framework v3
**Confidence Score:** 0.91

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

| Finding | Severity | Status | Location |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| **5 CVEs detected** | HIGH | Unpatched | api.scrt.network |
| **nginx 1.16.1 (EOL)** | HIGH | Outdated | API server |
| **HTTP/2 Rapid Reset** | HIGH | CVE-2023-44487 | API server |
| **Missing CSP header** | MEDIUM | Not configured | Main site |

---

## Executive Summary

Secret Network's main website is cleanly hosted on Framer with no vulnerabilities detected. However, the **API server (api.scrt.network)** presents significant security concerns with **5 CVEs detected** including the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack and an **end-of-life nginx version**. The RPC infrastructure uses Fastly CDN appropriately. Missing security headers on the main site reduce the overall security posture.

## Recommendations

### For Secret Network (Urgent)

1. **CRITICAL: Upgrade nginx** on API server to current stable version
2. **CRITICAL: Patch all CVEs** on api.scrt.network immediately
3. **HIGH: Add Content-Security-Policy** header to main site
4. **HIGH: Add X-Frame-Options** header
5. **MEDIUM: Review API server infrastructure** - consider migration to managed service
6. **MEDIUM: Hide server version** in headers

### For Users

1. **Be aware** of API server vulnerabilities when building applications
2. **Understand SGX trade-offs** vs cryptographic privacy
3. **Monitor governance** for ongoing foundation issues
4. **Use viewing keys** appropriately for sensitive data
5. **Consider backup** privacy options for critical use cases
