  "security_rating": "MEDIUM",
  "security_rating_justification": "Hop Protocol uses an optimistic security model with economic guarantees (110% collateral, 24-hour challenge period) that has proven effective with no exploits since 2021 launch. However, the permissioned Bonder whitelist, lack of documented bug bounty program, and reliance on active challenge watchers introduce trust assumptions. The 2-of-3 multisig control over critical parameters and 24-hour timelock (below recommended 48-hour) present moderate centralization risks. Multiple audits before launch and clean security track record are positive indicators.",

  "risk_summary": {
    "primary_risks": [
      "Permissioned Bonder whitelist - not fully decentralized",
      "24-hour challenge window requires active watchers",
      "2-of-3 multisig can change critical parameters",
      "No documented bug bounty program",
      "If all watchers fail, invalid transfers could succeed"
    ],
    "mitigating_factors": [
      "No exploits or security incidents since 2021 launch",
      "110% collateral requirement creates strong economic disincentives",
      "Open-source Challenge Watcher available",
      "Multiple pre-launch audits with all findings addressed",
      "Fallback to native rollup exits if Bonders offline",
      "Active DAO governance with HOP token"
    ],
    "worst_case_scenario": "If all Bonders go offline, transfers experience standard rollup exit delays (7+ days). If a malicious Bonder submits invalid transfer root AND no one challenges for 24 hours, fraudulent withdrawal could succeed (capped by Bonder's collateral)."
