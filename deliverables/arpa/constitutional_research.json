Originally founded in 2018 as ARPA Chain (privacy-preserving MPC network), it rebranded as ARPA Network and shifted focus to Threshold BLS Signature Schemes (TSS-BLS), a specialized subset of MPC. The network's threshold BLS signature infrastructure serves verifiable Random Number Generation (RNG), secure wallets, cross-chain bridges, and decentralized custody across multiple blockchains.",

  "description": "ARPA Network is a secure computation network that provides a threshold BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signature infrastructure for blockchain applications. It enables decentralized, verifiable, and blockchain-agnostic cryptographic services including random number generation, secure wallets, cross-chain bridges, and decentralized custody. As a privacy-preserving Layer 2 solution, ARPA uses secure multi-party computation to protect and validate transactions while increasing transaction processing times for practically any blockchain network. The network allows nodes to generate signatures asynchronously and in parallel, with a focus on security, flexibility, and multi-chain compatibility.",
