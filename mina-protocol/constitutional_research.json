  "description": "Mina Protocol is the world's lightest blockchain at approximately 22kb in size, using advanced cryptography and recursive zk-SNARKs to maintain this constant size. Mina is the first layer-1 to enable efficient implementation and easy programmability of zero knowledge smart contracts (zkApps). zkApps are Turing complete and offer enhanced privacy, off-chain computation, and composable proofs. With zkApps, user data never leaves local devices - only proofs are submitted to the chain, not personal data.",
