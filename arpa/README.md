# Arpa

## 📝 Description

ARPA Network is a secure computation network that provides a threshold BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signature infrastructure for blockchain applications. It enables decentralized, verifiable, and blockchain-agnostic cryptographic services including random number generation, secure wallets, cross-chain bridges, and decentralized custody. As a privacy-preserving Layer 2 solution, ARPA uses secure multi-party computation to protect and validate transactions while increasing transaction processing times for practically any blockchain network. The network allows nodes to generate signatures asynchronously and in parallel, with a focus on security, flexibility, and multi-chain compatibility.
