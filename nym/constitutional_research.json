      "value": "Nym is a decentralized privacy infrastructure that provides strong network-level privacy against sophisticated end-to-end attackers through a mixnet (mix network). The system uses a Noise Generating Mixnet (NGM) to mask user metadata by separating source and destination IP addresses, protecting both message content and communication patterns. Nym's mixnet encrypts data packets in multiple layers and routes them through a series of nodes (entry gateway, three mix nodes, and exit gateway) to anonymize various types of communication including messaging, file transfers, payments, and web browsing.",
