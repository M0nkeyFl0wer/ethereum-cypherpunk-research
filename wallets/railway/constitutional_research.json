  "project_name": "Railway Wallet - Private DeFi on Rails",
  "description": "Railway is a private DeFi wallet powered by the RAILGUN privacy network that uses advanced zkSNARKs technology to enable untraceable ERC-20 token transactions across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, and other chains. Users can shield tokens for complete transaction privacy, interact with public DeFi platforms (swaps, yield farming, liquidity provision) from private 0zk addresses, and maintain encrypted wallet data stored only locally with zero activity logs. The wallet includes compliance features like Viewing Keys, Private Proofs of Innocence (Privacy Pools), and tax reporting tools, available on desktop, iOS, and Android.",

      "value": "Railway Wallet demonstrates a well-architected multi-platform application with strong privacy integration through the RAILGUN Protocol. The codebase shows good separation of concerns, excellent TypeScript configuration, and effective code reuse across platforms. However, it suffers from a critical lack of automated testing, insufficient documentation, and some maintainability issues from overly large files. The security model is sound with proper key isolation and encrypted storage, but the project would benefit from formal security audits and automated dependency scanning.",
