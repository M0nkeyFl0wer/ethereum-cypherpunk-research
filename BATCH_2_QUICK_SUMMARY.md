## STATISTICS

### By Research Quality:
- **Excellent** (>20KB docs): 1 project (hopr - 29KB OPSEC)
- **Strong** (Multiple reports + active repos): 3 projects (firo, iron-fish, incognito)
- **Standard** (Meets all criteria): 3 projects (findora, fluidkey, iden3)

### By GitHub Activity:
- **Very Active** (755 stars): firo
- **Active** (976 stars): iron-fish
- **Moderate** (232 stars): hopr
- **Small/Focused**: findora (72⭐), fluidkey (41⭐), iden3 (14⭐)
- **Multi-repo** (48 repos): incognito

### Common Strengths:
- ✅ 100% have verified websites
- ✅ 100% have GitHub repository analysis (6 in CODE_REVIEW.md, 1 in sources/)
- ✅ 100% have documented smart contract research attempts
- ✅ 100% have TEAM.md with research documentation
- ✅ 100% have SECURITY.md with research documentation
- ✅ 86% (6/7) have news coverage or extensive analysis

### Common Weaknesses (Non-disqualifying):
- ⚠️ 100% have generic README descriptions (but real data in CODE_REVIEW)
- ⚠️ Some have template data in tech_stack_analysis.json
- ⚠️ All have empty project_metadata.json (but data exists elsewhere)

## KEY FINDINGS

### Notable Projects:
1. **hopr** - Most comprehensive (29KB OPSEC vulnerability assessment)
2. **firo** - Most active development (755 stars, Very Active status, last commit Oct 2025)
3. **iron-fish** - Largest repo (976 stars, 567 forks, 66 contributors, 1.5GB)
4. **incognito** - Best founder verification (CEO Duy Huynh, founded 2018, 48 repos)

### Data Quality Notes:
- All projects have **real GitHub analysis** with actual metrics
- Research attempts are **properly documented** even when unsuccessful
- Smart contract searches were **attempted for all** (most found no contracts)
- Template data exists but is **clearly separate** from real research

---

## ACTION REQUIRED

### Immediate:
✅ **NONE** - All projects pass minimum criteria

### Optional Improvements:
1. Update README.md descriptions from github_analysis.json
2. Generate CODE_REVIEW.md for incognito from sources/ data
3. Populate project_metadata.json from existing research
4. Remove or flag template JSON files
