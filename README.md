## 🔬 Research Methodology

Our research methodology prioritizes **verified, real data** over fabricated or speculative information. Every data point is traced to verifiable sources, and gaps are explicitly documented rather than filled with assumptions.

### Core Principles

**100% Real Data Only**
We never generate synthetic content, fabricate details, or use placeholder text. If information isn't available from verifiable sources, we explicitly report it as missing rather than creating fictional data.

**Multi-Source Verification**
Critical facts are verified across multiple independent sources (GitHub, official websites, blockchain explorers, audit reports). Each data point includes confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) based on source quality and verification depth.

**Explicit Gap Reporting**
Missing information is clearly documented in our research files. This transparency ensures readers understand what is known versus unknown about each project.

**Structured Data Collection**
All research is stored in both JSON (for data visualization and programmatic access) and markdown (for human readability). This dual format ensures data is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Research Layers

**Layer 1: Foundation Research**
- Project identification and categorization
- Website and GitHub discovery
- Core description and purpose
- Category classification

**Layer 2: GitHub API Integration**
- Repository statistics and metrics
- Programming language analysis
- Development activity patterns
- Contributor identification

**Layer 3: Deep Technical Analysis**
- Smart contract analysis
- Code quality assessment
- Architecture review
- Technology stack breakdown

**Layer 4: OSINT & Security Research**
- Team identification and verification
- Funding and investor research
- Security audit analysis
- Community intelligence gathering
