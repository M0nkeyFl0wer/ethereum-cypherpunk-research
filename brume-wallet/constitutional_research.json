  "description": "Brume Wallet is a non-custodial and private Ethereum wallet with built-in Tor network integration. It features built-in Tor to hide users' IP addresses from third parties, with each account having its own IP address for enhanced privacy. The wallet routes all network requests through the Tor protocol to prevent third-party services from accessing IP addresses, thereby protecting against tracking and censorship. Launched by Le Hash at the privacy-centric EthBrno hackathon 2022 edition where it won first place and the design award, Brume Wallet is available as a browser extension, website, and mobile application across Chrome, Firefox, and Android platforms. It is open source (MIT license) and free to use.",
