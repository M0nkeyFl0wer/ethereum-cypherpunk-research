  "description": "Zcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that allows transactions to be either transparent (like Bitcoin) or private using zero-knowledge proofs known as zk-SNARKs. This cryptography verifies transaction validity without exposing sender, recipient, or amount. As of 2025, approximately 20% of existing coins are shielded. The September 2025 launch of Zashi CrossPay enabled private cross-chain shielded swaps, significantly expanding Zcash's functionality for confidential transactions.",
