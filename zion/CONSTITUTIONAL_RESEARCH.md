# Zion

Zion is a peer-governed social network where members own their data through Web5 Architecture and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs). The platform includes a non-custodial Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet where users have full control of their funds and manage their own private keys. Zion uses the Lightning Network for near-instant micropayments and enables peer-to-peer content distribution without relying on centralized third parties. Messages are end-to-end encrypted and only viewable by users and their conversation partners.
