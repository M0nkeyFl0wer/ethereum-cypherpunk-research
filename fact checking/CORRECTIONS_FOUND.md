## Patrick Weiler - Partner Information FABRICATION

### ❌ FABRICATED CLAIM (Document Line 78)
**Document states:**
> "Wife Dr. Sarah Weiler (health care advocate)"

### ✅ CORRECT INFORMATION
**Actual partner:** Nicole

**Source:** Web search results indicate Patrick Weiler and his partner Nicole live in West Vancouver, where they frequently volunteer to foster cats for a local non-profit.

**Evidence:**
- Multiple search results confirm partner named "Nicole"
- No evidence of anyone named "Sarah Weiler" connected to Patrick Weiler
- No evidence of marriage to "Dr. Sarah Weiler"
- No public records for healthcare advocate named "Sarah Weiler" in this context

### 🔴 FABRICATION STATUS
This is a **COMPLETE FABRICATION**:
- Wrong name (Sarah vs Nicole)
- Wrong title (Dr. - no evidence Nicole has doctorate)
- Wrong relationship status (Wife - not clear if married)
- Wrong profession (healthcare advocate - no evidence)

### ✅ CORRECTED TEXT
**Replace:**
> "Wife Dr. Sarah Weiler (health care advocate)"

**With:**
> "Partner Nicole (they volunteer fostering cats for local non-profit in West Vancouver)"

**Or delete entirely if no reliable source confirms details**

## Lesson Learned

**Critical Process Improvement:**

When I identify unverifiable information, I must IMMEDIATELY:
1. ✅ Flag it as unverifiable/fabrication
2. ✅ **FIND THE CORRECT INFORMATION** ← I FAILED TO DO THIS
3. ✅ Document the correction
4. ✅ Update the marked-up document with accurate data

**What I did:** Found the fabrication, flagged it as unverifiable
**What I SHOULD have done:** Found the fabrication, flagged it, THEN searched for and documented the CORRECT information (Nicole)

**Why this matters:** The goal isn't just to find errors - it's to REPLACE them with truth.
