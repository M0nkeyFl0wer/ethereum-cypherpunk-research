# Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans (FOPO)

**Background:** New members have been appointed to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans (FOPO) which plays a decisive role in shaping Canada's Marine Protected Areas policy. Deep divisions exist between members advocating for full conservation measures and those pushing to exempt industrial activities like bottom trawling and open-net pen aquaculture from MPA restrictions. *\* Denotes active connections*

## 1\. Chair \- Patrick Weiler (Liberal \- West Vancouver \- Sunshine Coast \- Sea to Sky Country, BC)\*

![Patrick Weiler][image1]

Patrick Weiler, born in 1986, is a trained environmental and natural resource management lawyer (J.D., UBC; B.A., McGill). His legal career focused on environmental and aboriginal law. His work included collaboration at the United Nations to improve the management of aquatic ecosystems. Elected in 2019 and re-elected in 2021 and 2025\. He has worked with First Nations, governments, and international organizations on aquatic ecosystem governance and sustainability. As an MP, he has become one of the strongest Liberal voices for ocean protection.

Weiler supported the creation of Canada's largest Marine Protected Area in 2024 (\~133,000 km² off BC's coast) and consistently backs the federal 30x30 target. He has advocated for science-based marine conservation that incorporates Indigenous governance. Environmental organizations such as the David Suzuki Foundation frequently consult him on MPA strategy. He is expected to strongly support the Great Bear Sea MPA network, provided it upholds consultation and long-term ecosystem integrity.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Strong supporter of coastal MPAs; advocates for science-based protections, including no-trawl zones in sensitive habitats.  
- **Fish Farms:** Supports phasing out open-net pens in BC by 2025, citing risks to wild salmon. Backs Indigenous-led conservation.  
- **Licensing:** Supports reallocating salmon licenses to Indigenous fishers  
- **Coastline:** Riding in a B.C. coastal location.  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Close ties to Pacific Salmon Foundation; criticizes DFO for slow action on aquaculture reform.

## Voting Record

- ✅ **For** Bill C-55 (2019, expanded MPA designations)  
- ✅ **For** banning harmful fishing gear in MPAs (2023)  
- ❌ **Against** Conservative motions to delay B.C. fish farm closures (2022)

## Riding Information

- Safe Liberal Riding  
- Provincially riding has a Green MLA  
- Wealthier, educated voters (highest median income in Canada)  
- Strong environmentalist lean

## Additional Subcommittees

Member of the Liaison Committee

## Threat Matrix: Strong Support, Choir

Environmentalist in riding that supports environmentalism. In regular talks with other allies. Believes in science.

## Key Quotes

"We are fully committed to protecting wild pacific salmon and the work needed to reverse the current declines. Although I was disappointed that the DFO report in September did not include further analysis of the cumulative risk of all nine pathogens taken together independently or in conjunction with other cumulative risks to wild salmon such as sea lice, climate change, or overharvesting, this decision reaffirms my strong belief that we are on the right path." (patrickweiler.libparl.ca/2020)

"Wild salmon are an iconic species and British Columbians understand the necessity of protecting salmon stocks for future generations." (X 2021\)

"I recognize that we are at a critical juncture and that historic, decisive action must be taken now and in the coming years to ensure our wild pacific salmon not only survive but thrive." (patrickweiler.libparl.ca/2020)

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

Weiler, as FOPO Chair, projects an image of a moderate Liberal with environmentalist credentials (he's a former environmental lawyer). He has touted housing, climate adaptation, and Indigenous relations in local media. However, he has also publicly challenged his own party leadership. In late 2024 he argued that Prime Minister Trudeau "does not have the support of a significant amount of his caucus" and "should resign". These statements expose internal Liberal divisions and could be used to question his loyalty and consistency.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Weiler is active on Twitter and Instagram with mostly positive local content (community events, announcements). A notable digital posture is his endorsement of Mark Carney in the 2025 Liberal leadership race. Opponents might note his support for younger voter-friendly initiatives like lowering the voting age to 16, appealing to some but potentially seen as extreme by others. He generally avoids personal controversies online.

## Political & Policy Record

He was elected in 2019 and re-elected with growing margins. Policy-wise, Weiler has emphasized environmental protection: he defended carbon pricing and climate action in his riding. He sponsored water infrastructure and Indigenous partnership projects in BC. His committee work includes climate change and indigenous affairs, but FOPO as Chair is his primary role. He has also backed electoral reform (Bill C-210) and an immediate Gaza ceasefire, positions not universally popular.

**Key Chiefs:** Dustin "Khelsilem" Rivers (Chairperson, Squamish Nation), Lenora Joe (Chief, shíshálh Nation)

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

**Reputation:** Generally seen as a conscientious MP, Weiler's main vulnerability is his willingness to publicly air internal dissent. Campaigns can highlight him as part of the party "mutiny," undermining his own leadership. **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Lack of fishing industry ties leaves him open to "elitist", "West Van privilege" and "anti-worker" attacks. Some pushback from yacht clubs/commercial fishers, but outweighed by eco-conscious voters.

## Opposition & Critics

- **Surrey Board of Trade:** Leaked 2022 email criticizing his "anti-business" MPA rules  
- **BC Salmon Farmers Association:** Target Weiler's fish farm phase-out stance (2024)

## Ethics & Disclosure

No reports of conflict-of-interest investigations or legal proceedings involving Weiler are found in public records. His required annual disclosures have not flagged any problematic interests, and no media or watchdog reports have accused him of unethical conduct.

## 2\. Vice Chair \- Mel Arnold (Conservative \- Kamloops \- Shuswap \- Central Rockies, BC)

![Mel Arnold][image2]

Mel Arnold is a senior Conservative MP with a background in wildlife and angling organizations. He is a longstanding critic of the federal 30x30 target and MPAs he sees as lacking consultation or economic planning. Between 1980's and 2015 was the owner of Twin Anchors Fishing Lodge (Salmon Arm, BC). As a director of the BC Wildlife Federation (2009 \- 2015\) lobbied for hunting/fishing access.

Arnold has directly criticized the Great Bear Sea MPA plan, citing testimony from BC fishers who felt betrayed by DFO's decisions. He argues for adaptive marine management rather than strict no-take zones and calls current MPA expansion politically motivated.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Opposes "top-down" MPAs; argues they harm sport fishing and coastal economies. Pushed for exemptions in protected zones.  
- **Fish Farms:** Fierce defender of salmon farms; accuses Liberals of "destroying rural jobs." Rejects claims that farms harm wild salmon.  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Receives strong support from BC aquaculture industry; has called DFO science "biased."

## Voting Record

- ❌ **Against** all MPA expansions (2019–2024)  
- ✅ **For** extending open-net pen licenses (2023)

## Riding Information

- Conservative stronghold  
- Working-class, with strong ranching/mining/forestry ties

## Additional Subcommittees

None

## Threat Matrix: Strong Opposition, Atheist Accelerationist

## Key Quotes

"The government is disregarding years of aquaculture science to satisfy environmental extremists." (2023, FOPO meeting)

"These protected areas are being imposed without consultation, sacrificing coastal jobs for urban environmental votes." (Hansard, 2021\)

"I am honoured again to be reappointed as Associate Shadow Minister for Fisheries. I look forward to continuing my work to protect and restore Canada's fish stocks and fisheries." (X-05-21-25)

"After nine years and seven different fisheries ministers, Liberals have failed for Canada's fish harvesters. A Conservative will put science first, restore law and order, and protect harvester rights. Conservatives will restore sustainable fisheries and ensure fairness in Canada's coastal communities." (X \-04-17-25)

"B.C.'s shrimp fishery is collapsing, unlike our neighbour's shrimp fisheries, which are harvesting record catches, driving strong coastal communities and providing healthy nutrition and protein for their communities. This is the result of DFO's Pacific shrimp resource management, which has heaped six \- yes, six \- precautionary approaches on B.C.'s fisheries with zero consideration of the cumulative effects that these have on British Columbia." (December 4, 2024, FOPO 133\)

## Key Influencers/Allies

- **Dan Edwards, President, BC Wildlife Federation:** Close ally on hunting/fishing policy  
- **Bob Zimmer, Former Conservative MP:** Mentor on rural resource issues  
- **Owen Bird, Sport Fishing Institute of BC:** Pushes for recreational fishing access  
- **John Rustad, BC Conservative Leader:** Ally in anti-regulation fights (e.g., salmon farm closures)  
- *Jordan Sturdy, Former BC Liberal MLA:*\* Collaborator on fisheries

## Public Statements & Credibility

A vocal climate skeptic, Arnold has repeatedly downplayed human-driven climate change. In 2015 he said he was "unconvinced by evidence" of global warming and viewed climate science as unsettled. He also opposed the federal carbon tax in letters and public statements, drawing criticism from environmental advocates. These stances undermine his credibility on environmental issues, especially in a committee focused on ecosystems and MPAs.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Arnold maintains active Facebook and Instagram pages for his Conservative campaigns, promoting social conservative views. He has endorsed pro-life legislation (voting for a ban on sex-selective abortion) and supported anti-transgender "parental rights" rhetoric. This mixed record reflects a socially conservative brand.

## Political & Policy Record

Arnold votes reliably with the Conservative caucus. Notably he supported legislation to increase penalties on parents of transgender youth and has opposed many Liberal environmental initiatives. He has championed repealing climate policy and cutting funding for environmental programs, aligning with the party's resource industry ties.

## Affiliations & Relationships

An outspoken evangelical Christian, Arnold is closely aligned with right-wing interest groups. Campaign Life Coalition rates him highly on "pro-life" issues. He was a leader in forming Conservative Bible study groups on Parliament Hill and maintains ties to social conservative lobbyists.

**Key Chiefs:** Rosanne Casimir – Kukpi7 (Chief), Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc (250‑828‑9700)

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

**Reputation:** Locally he's portrayed as a principled but polarizing figure. In BC media he was criticized as "disgracefully" undermining science with social ideology. His persistence in arguing against scientific consensus makes him vulnerable to attack in general electorates. **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Deep aquaculture ties contradict Conservative "local worker" rhetoric. Arnold's 2015 statements questioning human-caused climate change are well-documented. He told CBC he was "unconvinced" by climate science and believed only 1.5% of greenhouse gas emissions are human-caused.

## Opposition & Critics

- **Anti-MPA Bias:** Arnold's lodge relied on fishing access; his votes align with industry, not science  
- **Donor Influence:** 23% of donations from regulated industries he oversees  
- **Arnold's defence:** Claims to advocate for "rural livelihoods"

## Ethics & Disclosure

Arnold was publicly criticized by media and scientists for downplaying farm risks using industry-funded reports. Not formally sanctioned: No ethics violation was found, but the conflict between his statements and DFO science is documented.

## 3\. Vice Chair \- Alexis Deschênes (Bloc Québécois \- Gaspésie \- Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine \- Listugu)

![Alexis Deschênes][image3]

Alexis Deschênes is a newly elected MP representing a major political upset: in the 2025 federal election, he unseated long-time Liberal incumbent and Fisheries Minister Diane Lebouthillier. Received 46% of vote. A former Radio-Canada journalist and Parti Québécois-affiliated media figure, Deschênes is known for his sharp political communication skills and advocacy for Quebec autonomy, especially in resource management.

He has positioned himself as a champion of coastal communities, promising to defend the interests of small-scale fisheries and oppose federal overreach in Quebec's jurisdiction. While Bloc Québécois MPs often support environmental policies in theory, they tend to oppose federal MPA expansions that threaten the economic interests of Quebec-based industries.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Focused on St. Lawrence River protections; supports MPAs but demands Quebec control over regulations.  
- **Fish Farms:** Skeptical of Atlantic Canada's aquaculture expansion; prioritizes local small-scale fisheries.  
- **Licenses:** Focuses on Quebec-controlled fishing licenses in the St. Lawrence.  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Close to Quebec fishing cooperatives; avoids Pacific debates however prioritizes small-scale fisheries over industrial aquaculture which may translate to BC.

## Voting Record

- N/A (Newly elected; no voting record yet)

## Riding Information

- Riding was held by Liberals (and Liberal Fisheries Cabinet Minister) from 2015 \- 2025  
- The region includes the Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands, with the Listuguj Indian Reserve representing the Mi'kmaq First Nation  
- 91% of residents speak French  
- A significant portion of the population falls within the 45-64 age group  
- Average income: $43,280

## Additional Subcommittees

N/A

## Threat Matrix: Possible Soft Support, Congregation

Appears to be quite ethical. Worked as a journalist. Quit and got a law degree. Top of his class. Refused offers from big firms. Became legal aid lawyer in his home town. Strong supporter of fisheries but supports limited fishing if fishermen/women are compensated.

## Key Quotes

"Québec alone should manage its marine resources." (Le Devoir, 2023\)

"As for inshore fishing, we want to promote a model where fishing is done by family businesses that are handed down from father to son, with inshore fishers taking just enough from the sea to make a living, without going to extremes, like the factory ships have too often done in recent history." (2025-05-30 12:51)

"What worries the Bloc Québécois about fisheries is the oil drilling that the Liberal government is prepared to green-light. It will definitely disturb marine wildlife, and that worries us." (2025-05-30 12:51)

"When we talk about marine protected areas, we need to make sure we're involving the people who know these waters best \- our fishermen and coastal communities." (FOPO committee, 2025\)

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

A former journalist and Parti Québécois organizer, Deschênes is new to Ottawa as of 2025\. In his maiden remarks he positioned himself as a defender of local fisheries and critic of Ottawa's oversight. He notably unseated veteran Fisheries Minister Diane Lebouthillier in 2025, emphasizing dissatisfaction in the Gaspé. Media coverage highlights that he promised to challenge Ottawa on fishery closures and to negotiate on behalf of small-scale fishermen. His public communications stress Quebec interests first, giving him credibility with nationalist voters but inviting scrutiny from federalists.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Deschênes has a minimal public digital footprint beyond his campaign announcements. He tweets primarily in French about Bloc policies. No controversial social posts have been reported. His campaign messaging was carried on Bloc-aligned Facebook and news outlets, which emphasize sovereignty and resource management.

## Political & Policy Record

He has no parliamentary track record before 2025\. However, his PQ background suggests he will push aggressively for Quebec control of fisheries and oppose federal conservation measures viewed as economically harmful. For example, Bloc MPs have historically opposed enlarged MPAs off Quebec's coasts. Deschênes is likely to mirror this stance. This will be an area to highlight: whether he will side with fishers over ocean health regulations, potentially risking backlash from environmental groups.

## Affiliations & Relationships

As Bloc Deputy Whip and new Deputy House Leader, Deschênes is closely allied with party leader Yves-François Blanchet. He is also associated with fishermen's associations in the Gaspé and Quebec's nationalist wing. His network includes PQ figures and activists, suggesting loyalty to Quebec's interests over national policies. These ties are strengths in Quebec but could be framed as parochial by opponents.

## Staff & Family

**Staff:** No staff names or positions publicly available yet from Parliament Hill directory, his campaign press releases, social media platforms or official website, LinkedIn or professional profiles. Likely still in the early hiring phase, given his April 2025 election. Staff details may emerge in the coming weeks.

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

**Reputation:** So far Deschênes has a clean image. Attacks on him will likely focus on his support from left-wing environmental NGOs (Bloc's green credentials) vs. his role on fisheries. For example, opponents might accuse him of flip-flopping if he appears to side with fishers against environmental limits. To date, no personal scandals are known. His rapid rise (going from journalist to MP to vice-chair) may invite scrutiny over experience. **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Could be painted as "parochial" for ignoring Pacific issues.

## 4\. Member \- Paul Connors (Liberal \- Avalon, NFL)

![Paul Connors][image4]

Paul Connors, elected in April 2025, is the former Executive Director of the Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Agriculture and a long-time aide to the former MP for the riding, Ken McDonald, a well-known voice for Atlantic fishers. Connors' policy framework centers on food security and economic resilience in coastal communities.

Connors has not made strong public statements about MPAs in BC, but his background suggests skepticism toward blanket restrictions. He is likely to support marine conservation that demonstrably supports fish stock recovery and job stability, particularly in regions where fisheries are core to local economies.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Supports MPAs but insists on fishing industry input  
- **Fish Farms:** Backs Atlantic salmon aquaculture as critical to NB's economy; opposes "blanket bans"

## Voting Record

- N/A (Newly elected; no voting record yet)

## Riding Information

- Safe Liberal Riding  
- The Avalon Peninsula's economy is a mix of traditional industries (fishing primarily), aquaculture, offshore energy and modern service-based sectors  
- Median income: $49,000

## Additional Subcommittees

Member, Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food

## Threat Matrix: Possible Soft Support, Congregation

## Key Quotes

"Ken has done exceptional work in the Avalon riding over the past 10 years. I thought that as his EA, I could carry some of that with me and hopefully be able to do that moving forward."

"People don't realize how important the agricultural industry is to Newfoundland and Labrador and to food sustainability. When we hear talk of tariffs and the potential changes to the supply management program, to the industry here in Newfoundland, that's dramatic." (Shoreline News 04.27.2025)

"It's important to do the right thing, and that's what I'll be bringing to Ottawa. I'll also be bringing a wealth of experience and knowledge of the system and the issues and opportunities that are facing residents of Avalon riding from all sectors." (Shoreline News, 04.27.2025)

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

His public profile focuses on local issues: affordability, fisheries management in NL, and support for veterans (Avalon includes St. John's). There's no record of any inflammatory statements. His voting record (since 2025\) has so far aligned with the Liberal caucus. Without distinctive positions, he is unlikely to be a narrative driver in committee.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Digitally clumsy. Socials are lacking. Posts are amateurish. LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-connors-0137b7138/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-connors-0137b7138/)

## Political & Policy Record

**Federal record:** N/A (newly elected). **Council record includes:** Building a greatly appreciated community arena; Granting a quarry permit (Councillor Paul Connors moved to defer the decision for a public hearing, but did not second. He ultimately voted to approve, stating it was a routine ownership transfer with no increase in activity, and echoed concerns about safety and infrastructure around the area). This indicates a pragmatic approach: weighing community concerns and procedural fairness, yet supporting economic continuity.

## Affiliations & Relationships

**Key Influencers/Allies:** Ken McDonald \- former MP of the riding and Connors' boss/mentor. One thing he learned from McDonald is the importance of speaking up for your constituents, even if it makes you unpopular in some quarters. Keith Sullivan \- Connors publicly thanked Sullivan for "fighting for harvesters" in a March 2024 Facebook post.

## Staff & Family

**Staff:** No staff names publicly listed yet in the GEDS directory, Parliamentary directory, LinkedIn, or constituency communications. Campaign Staff: Likely involved during the April 2025 campaign, but no personnel (Communications Director, Campaign Manager) cited in press or social streams. Planning Phase: As a new MP, staff appointments may be forthcoming. Possible staff (former volunteer) Chris G. Fudge publicly thanked Paul: "It was an absolute honour … helped full on with your campaign" on Facebook.

**Family:** Wife Michelle Connors; Children: Jenna Connors (24), Bradley Connors (27, Hockey player Conception Bay Blues). Family, including extended family, is paramount to Paul and almost stopped him from running.

## Notable Donors

- **David Dwyer:** Works as deckhand at Clearwater Fisheries aboard MV Newfoundland Victor, and an ironworker on offshore oil projects  
- **Frank Hender:** Soil & Plant Lab Supervisor at Agriculture Canada; also runs an organic vegetable farm in Foxtrap

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

**Reputation:** Clean reputation. No known controversies.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:** Connors largest vulnerability may lie in his tunnel vision about his community/riding. While many will find his single-minded devotion admirable, his inability to look beyond that could make him ineffective on a larger stage, rendering him ineffectual. His career as an agri-consultant could be attacked if any government grants or subsidies to his sector arose, but no such issues have surfaced.

## Opposition & Critics

Potential weaknesses include the fact that Avalon was targeted by Conservatives (strong national campaigns run by candidates like Matthew Chapman, whose wife actually ran against him), so he may be seen as representing a party under fire in the region.

- **Fish Farms:** Strongly pro-aquaculture; calls B.C. farm closures "a dangerous precedent"  
- **Licenses:** Advocates for corporate-friendly fishing quotas  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Former fisheries union organizer; closely aligned with Atlantic seafood industry

## Voting Record

- ✅ **For** subsidies for closed-containment aquaculture (2023)  
- ❌ **Against** Conservative motions to weaken MPA monitoring (2022)

## Riding Information

Supports fish farms and has spoken out against MPAs

## Key Quotes

"We need a balanced approach to aquaculture \- it's vital for rural economies." (2023)

"I can no longer defend my government on this issue. I stand with the fishermen" Regarding Right Whale Protection measures. (2024)

Advocated for "science-based regulation" over outright bans in FOPO meetings. (2023)

2016 Fisheries Act Statement: "The Fisheries Act is an essential tool to support the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat and the sustainability of fisheries... without fish habitat there is no fisheries." (2016-12-06)

On Aquatic Health Program: "The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the health of Canada's wild and farmed fish from aquatic animal diseases... Canadian seafood is known for its excellent quality, and we built that reputation by protecting our wild and farmed aquatic animals." (2016-10-03)

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

Cormier is known for sometimes breaking ranks with his party. He has publicly sided with fishing communities. For example, in 2023-24 he openly criticized his own government's fishery closures, saying he "can no longer defend \[it\]" and "stands with fishermen" against right-whale protections. This rare breach of caucus unity can be presented as evidence he's a loose cannon. He also reportedly joined Weiler in calling on PM Trudeau to resign after the Freeland resignation. Such rebelliousness can be spun both ways: as principled or as destabilizing.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Cormier's online presence is modest; he tweets about rural life and Atlantic issues. There is no record of extreme or off-color posts. He did, however, remove himself from some government roles during the caucus upheaval, which briefly made social media mention his internal opposition. His digital signals, overall, are currently pro-fisheries and critical of the carbon tax.

## Political & Policy Record

A longtime Liberal MP (first elected 2015). Was once Parliamentary Secretary to the Fisheries Minister, which gave him direct involvement in policy. His record shows a focus on Atlantic economic issues. He has expressed concern that stringent MPA/whale rules hurt inshore fisheries. This pragmatic stance won't hurt him with local voters, but it may alienate environmental groups and could be framed as putting industry over conservation.

## Affiliations & Relationships

Cormier's base is in New Brunswick's francophone Acadian region; he has strong ties to local unions and fishers' associations. He's aligned with moderate Liberals but participated in the faction calling for leadership change. He is viewed as close to the Atlantic caucus rebels (Arsenault, etc.) who demanded better treatment for rural communities.

- **Arren Sock** \- Chief, Elsipogtog FN (506-523-8200)

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

Cormier is respected locally but seen as a maverick in Ottawa. His key vulnerability: being targeted by Conservatives/Bloc as a flip-flopper on both environment (whales) and party loyalty. The fact that he publicly "no longer defends" his government on fisheries could be spun by opponents as evidence of inconsistency or extreme partisanship. No personal scandals are known, but he was demoted from a PR role after the WE scandal (which he protested), suggesting a somewhat uneasy position in the party.

**Potential Vulnerability:** May be out of favour with the government over breach of party discipline. Concentrated on East Coast issues.

## Opposition & Critics

In May 2024, Cormier publicly criticized his own government's right whale protection measures, stating "I can no longer defend my government on this issue. I stand with the fishermen". This rare breach of party discipline was widely reported.

Cormier was among Liberal MPs calling for Trudeau's resignation in late 2024, expressing satisfaction when Trudeau announced his departure in January 2025\.

## 6\. Member \- Chris d'Entremont (Conservative \- Acadie—Annapolis, NS)

![Chris d'Entremont][image6]

Chris d'Entremont is a veteran politician from Nova Scotia, elected federally in 2019 after serving nearly two decades in provincial politics, including as Nova Scotia's Minister of Health. He was appointed Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons in 2021 and has continued in that role through 2025, making him one of the most senior Atlantic Conservatives in Parliament.

While d'Entremont's public profile is relatively moderate, he has consistently voted in line with Conservative positions on fisheries, natural resources, and crime. He has also opposed several Liberal environmental initiatives, including carbon pricing and marine conservation regulations perceived as harmful to rural economies. His rural Nova Scotia riding includes both coastal communities and agricultural interests, and he is seen as a reliable advocate for those sectors. Though less ideologically aggressive than some of his caucus colleagues, d'Entremont is expected to side with industry voices on issues like marine protected areas unless significant community consultation and economic guarantees are secured.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Opposes "strict" MPAs; argues they hurt lobster fisheries. Favors voluntary measures  
- **Fish Farms:** Supports expanding aquaculture in Atlantic Canada  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Vocal critic of DFO "overreach"

## Voting Record

- ❌ **Against** all new Atlantic MPAs (2020–2024)  
- ✅ **For** fast-tracking fish farm approvals (2023)

## Riding Information

**Riding Status:** Conservatives barely won this riding with Chris just scraping by to be re-elected. He won the seat by only 533 votes over the Liberal candidate **Economy:** Agriculture and agri-business, AgriTech, Manufacturing, Tourism, Aquaculture, fisheries **Median Income:** $33,200 (2020) **Geography:** Coastal community **Additional Subcommittees:** Co-Chair of the Joint Interparliamentary Council; Past Deputy Speaker and Chair of Committees of the Whole

## Threat Matrix: Opposition, Atheist

## Key Quotes

In 2021, d'Entremont praised harvesters' "stewardship of marine resources" during a lobster fishery debate

"Mr. Speaker, the economy of Acadie—Annapolis in rural Nova Scotia relies heavily on a strong lobster fishery, yet this past season, it went from bad to worse. According to a Global News report on May 2, some harvesters in southwest Nova Scotia had to give up on their season because they could not fish profitably. There were no lobsters and no price, and this is unacceptable. Will the Minister of Fisheries finally listen to commercial fishers, where her predecessors failed to act, to take unregulated and unreported fishing seriously and implement immediate measures to protect our lobster stocks before it is too late?" (June 11, 2025\)

## Public Statements & Credibility

As Deputy Speaker of the House, d'Entremont is generally restrained publicly. He made national news in late 2024 when Liberal MP Yvan Baker accused him of applying partisan pressure in rulings (d'Entremont "barred \[Baker\] from speaking" under alleged Conservative influence). While d'Entremont denied wrongdoing, the episode painted him as a partisan enforcer of Conservative discipline. This could be used to argue he is too aligned with party bosses, undermining his image of impartiality.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

- **Instagram:** @chrisdentremontns  
- **Facebook:** facebook.com/chris.dentremont

## Political & Policy Record

D'Entremont's background is in municipal politics; federally he has not championed any signature policy beyond typical Conservative positions. He supports resource development (gold, timber) and rural interests, but has not made waves on fisheries or environment in Parliament. His Conservative voting record is solidly in line with the party, including support for tough-on-crime measures.

## Affiliations & Relationships

He served as Nova Scotia PC Party President (2009–2010) before returning to federal politics, indicating strong provincial Conservative ties. His networks include small-business and natural resource stakeholders in Nova Scotia, as well as long-standing alliances within the Conservative establishment.

- **Bear River FN** \- Contact via main office (Chief name not listed publicly)

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

D'Entremont has a reputation as a low-key backbencher. The Baker incident is a rare public controversy, opponents may highlight it to suggest he places party loyalty over fairness. No legal or financial misconduct is known. His long tenure (MP since 2015\) could be spun as being part of the "insider" elite.

**Potential Vulnerability:** Given d'Entremont's razor-thin election margin (533 votes), he can't afford to alienate moderates or key industries like lobster fisheries. MPAs could be framed as a proactive compromise, highlighting that flexible, industry-co-designed protections could prevent future stock collapses (and avoid catastrophic fishery closures), while securing support from coastal tourism operators and younger voters. Top-down Ottawa mandates will trigger his "DFO overreach" reflex.

## Opposition & Critics

Accusations of biased rulings (e.g., Yvan Baker incident) make him vulnerable to looking like a "party puppet."

Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs: D'Entremont has clashed with Indigenous groups over lobster quotas, but if a major band (e.g., Bear River First Nation) supported a specific MPA plan, it could pressure him.

## 7\. Member \- Aaron Gunn (Conservative \- North Island-Powell River, BC)

![Aaron Gunn][image7]

Aaron Gunn is a new MP and right-wing media personality known for viral videos opposing the Great Bear Sea MPA and attacking federal marine policies. In his 2023 video "No Fishing Allowed," he accused MPAs of being unscientific and economically devastating, while omitting Indigenous and scientific perspectives.

Gunn's rhetoric has sparked backlash from Indigenous leaders (e.g., Tla'amin Nation) and academics, who say his framing distorts MPA goals. Despite this, he remains a polarizing but influential voice among anti-regulation voters.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Calls MPAs "economic threats"; wants more industry consultation  
- **Fish Farms:** Aggressively pro-fish farms; accuses activists of "spreading misinformation"  
- **Licensing:** Campaigned to fast-track fishing licenses for industry allies  
- **Coastline:** Riding on BC coast. supports oil tanker traffic  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Close ties to BC Salmon Farmers Association; opposes Indigenous veto power over farms

## Voting Record

N/A (Newly elected; no voting record yet)

## Riding Information

**Riding Status:** Riding was solidly NDP but due to Liberal vote splitting, Gunn was able to get in. COVID/Anti Vax/Truckers protests alongside cost of living and drug/crime issues fueled many of the Conservative votes **Economy:** Coastal riding with deep ties to forestry and fishing **Average Income:** $49,040 **Additional Subcommittees:** N/A

## Threat Matrix: Strong Opposition, Atheist \- Accelerationist

## Key Quotes

"Woke environmentalists killing BCs resource sector" (Source: His now-deleted Twitter/X account)

Gunn has asserted that the MPA network is an arbitrary, unilateral, politically motivated move by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to shut down commercial and recreational fishing on the West Coast to appease the "agenda of radical environmentalists."

2025-06-18 Resource Sector Recognition: "Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize the contributions of the incredible resource sector workers in my riding and, indeed, the country. They are the loggers, the miners, the farmers, the fishermen and the energy sector workers in oil and natural gas. They are the hard-working men and women of this country whose work gives us the lumber with which we build our homes and the fuel with which we heat them, the gas that moves us from A to B, and the food and fish that sustain us."

2025-06-02 "Green Ideology" Attack: "These are Canadian workers who have had their livelihoods, their ability to put food on the table to feed their families, sacrificed by the Liberals and the NDP on the altar of this green ideology... No one does safety and environmental stewardship better than Canada or better than Canadians, and as long as the world needs lumber, minerals, or oil and natural gas, as much of it as possible should come from right here in Canada."

Cultural Erosion Comments: "Right now, in Canada in so many ways, it feels as if right side up is upside down and common sense no longer exists. That brings me to the cultural erosion that we have seen, the tearing down of statues, the erasing of our history."

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

Gunn is an internet activist turned MP known for hard-right views on drug policy and social issues. He promoted anti-harm-reduction propaganda: his viral video "Vancouver Is Dying" blamed BC's fentanyl crisis on safe consumption sites and decriminalization. He portrayed addicts as criminals, ignoring expert consensus on the causes of addiction. Opponents can cite his own work characterizing overdose prevention as "enabling killers".

Gunn was disqualified from the BC Liberal leadership race over public comments denying that the gender pay equity gap exists and saying that systemic racism is a "myth."

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Gunn is active on X (Twitter) and YouTube, with a large following for his Conservative commentary. Notoriously, he was disqualified from a 2021 BC Liberal leadership contest after tweets dismissing "gender diversity" and "systemic racism" as myths. These posts, obtained from archives, underscore a willingness to espouse inflammatory, divisive views online. His social channels frequently praise Pierre Poilievre and attack Liberals.

- **Twitter/X:** @AaronGunn  
- **Facebook:** facebook.com/AaronGunn.ca  
- **YouTube:** Aaron Gunn (@AaronGunnBC)

## Political & Policy Record

First elected in 2025, Gunn had no parliamentary record prior to this. His activism indicates he will oppose any expansion of health-based approaches to drug use and will prioritize law-and-order policies. He has joined Poilievre's tough-on-crime messaging and will likely support regressive drug laws. His prior shifting from the BC Liberals to a self-described "Common Sense" conservative platform suggests opportunism.

## Affiliations & Relationships

He co-founded Common Sense BC (aligned with Poilievre's federal movement) and worked with billionaire-funded networks (Pacific Prosperity) to elect like-minded politicians. Gunn's alliances include far-right media personalities and activists; he is celebrated by anti-harm-reduction groups. These connections may be used to portray him as influenced by fringe donors and ideologues.

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

Gunn is widely seen (by health advocates and media) as a divisive, hardline figure. Filter Magazine calls him an influential catalyst for Canada's "rightward shift on drug policy."

**Major Controversies:** Gunn has openly denied that Canada's residential school system constitutes a genocide. Between 2019-2021, Gunn posted on social media denying Indigenous genocide in Canada and claiming "residential schools were asked for by Indigenous bands". A 2020 post stated "There was no genocide. Stop lying to people and read a book".

Multiple First Nations groups, including Wei Wai Kum First Nations and BC's First Nations Leadership Council, called for his removal as candidate. Chief Councillor Chris Roberts stated Gunn's "remarks from years ago were not just careless, they seem to reflect his true beliefs".

**Potential Vulnerability:** His disqualification in the 2022 BC Liberal leadership race for bigoted comments exposes a vulnerability to being labeled racist or extremist. Highly divisive character. Voters highly motivated to "not let that happen again" (regarding vote splitting).

## Opposition & Critics

In response to Gunn's assertions in his video, "No Fishing Allowed: Trudeau's plan to decimate an entire industry," Daniel Pauly, an ocean fisheries expert at the University of British Columbia says: "The notion that marine protected areas don't work and that they harm the fishery and fishes is simply a lie."

**"Vancouver is Dying" Documentary:** Gunn's viral 2021 documentary on Vancouver's drug crisis has received over 4.5 million views but was criticized for misrepresenting addiction policy and stigmatizing marginalized populations.

## 8\. Member \- Ernie Klassen (Liberal \- White Rock South Surrey, BC)

![Ernie Klassen][image8]

Ernie Klassen, elected in 2025, is a former White Rock city councillor and small business owner who built his profile through the White Rock Pride Society and local chambers of commerce. He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries in June 2025 and joined the FOPO committee. He is the first openly gay person elected in the riding.

Klassen has publicly stated that fisheries are "vital to our local economy and environment" and supports measures that ensure long-term ocean health. While new to federal policy, he generally follows the Liberal line. His urban riding lacks major fishery interests but includes eco-tourism and sustainability advocates.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Supports science-based protections but emphasizes local economic impacts. Likely to align with Liberal policy (e.g., 30% ocean protection by 2030), but may push for exemptions for recreational fisheries (key to White Rock's economy)  
- **Licensing:** Pledged "fair access" to licenses for small-scale fishers  
- **Coastline:** Riding is on the BC Coast  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Balancing local seafood industry concerns (e.g., crab/lobster fisheries) with environmental goals

## Voting Record

N/A (Newly elected; no voting record yet)

## Riding Information

**Riding Status:** Formerly ultra-Conservative riding won with a small (1000 vote) margin by an openly gay man **Demographics:** Urban shoreline riding, mix of suburban families, small businesses, and aging population **Average Income:** $63,550 **Additional Subcommittees/Roles:** Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries

## Threat Matrix: Possible Soft Support, Congregation

While Klassen presents as Liberal, he has made statements within the past two years about his belief that politics has become too extreme with both the left and the right being out of touch with what the public actually wants, which is something in the middle. In order to support MPAs Klassen would need to understand that creating them will actually help with fishing stocks and therefore will help people live better lives and have more prosperous jobs. If that is a long term issue, he may fall into a compensation camp for fishermen/women. He also tends to side with small businesses. This could be exploited in a fight against big industry just so long as it does not come across as a radical agenda by too far left environmentalists.

## Key Quotes

"We need to protect wild salmon and coastal jobs together." (2023)

"Stormwater runoff is poisoning our beaches and killing shellfish beds. Upgrading our infrastructure isn't glamorous, but it's one of the most important things we can do for Semiahmoo Bay." (Council debate on drainage upgrades, Peace Arch News, June 16, 2021\)

"We've waited too long for senior governments to act on oil spill monitoring. Local waters are our economic lifeblood;we need to protect them now." (Motion urging stronger federal spill response, Council Minutes, October 8, 2019\)

"The pier and harbor aren't just tourist attractions;they support commercial fishing and local jobs. Let's stop waiting and fix them." (Advocating for pier repairs, Surrey Now-Leader, July 22, 2021\)

"Dredging the harbor isn't optional. If we let silt build up, we're choking off small-boat fishermen and recreational users." (Budget meeting on harbor maintenance, Council Minutes, August 10, 2022\)

"We can develop the waterfront responsibly, but not at the cost of public access or marine health. Every project needs to meet higher standards." (Miramar Village development vote, White Rock Sun, June 5, 2023\)

"East Beach shouldn't become a private playground. Protecting public shoreline access matters as much as economic growth." (Opposing commercial expansion plans, Council Meeting, March 14, 2020\)

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

As a city councillor in White Rock, Klassen focused on pragmatic ocean issues (pollution, infrastructure) over ideological debates. He emphasized local economic impacts (fishing, tourism) in marine policy decisions. No recorded quotes on broader fisheries/aquaculture conflicts (e.g., salmon farms), as these were outside municipal jurisdiction.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

**Platforms:** Active on Facebook/X, focuses on local events (e.g., Surrey Vaisakhi Parade). **Controversies:** None found yet (new MP, minimal digital trail).

## Political & Policy Record

During his tenure on White Rock City Council (2018-2025), Ernie Klassen demonstrated a pragmatic approach to environmental issues, supporting practical measures like stormwater upgrades to protect Semiahmoo Bay, advocating for pier repairs and harbor dredging to maintain fishing and tourism infrastructure, and voting for the city's Climate Action Plan while expressing concerns about business costs. However, he opposed stricter tree protection bylaws, citing property rights, and consistently supported waterfront development projects like Miramar Village, drawing criticism from environmental advocates.

Klassen backed council motions urging stronger oil spill monitoring and joined consensus submissions about marine protected areas, though his personal stance on broader fisheries issues like aquaculture wasn't prominently recorded at the municipal level. His record reflects a balance between development priorities and targeted environmental protections, with a focus on local infrastructure needs.

## Affiliations & Relationships

He is connected to BC Liberals at the municipal level, but federally will caucus with Liberal team. His social circle includes local LGBTQ organizations and city officials. No extreme or divisive affiliations have been identified.

- **Jennine Cook** \- Councillor, Semiahmoo FN

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

**Ethics/Disclosure:** There are no known scandals or financial issues. Unless he takes an unusual position in committee, he may not be a major target.

**Potential Vulnerability:** Being a fresh face, Klassen has yet to accumulate political liabilities. Potential lines of attack include that he barely won the riding (implying it's "soft" support) or that his inclusive brand conflicts with the suburban character of White Rock (this seems weak). He almost ran provincially for BC United, believing that most political parties were either too far left or too far right. His positions on social issues might be tested by hard right wing colleagues like Aaron Gunn who is definitely not for DEI or inclusivity. A wedge could be planted.

## Opposition & Critics

He has largely avoided controversy. His public remarks focus on local concerns (housing, senior care) and he emphasizes community unity. There is no evidence of contentious statements; early interviews (e.g. Surrey Now) highlights his pledge to be an "advocate for inclusivity".

## 9\. Member \- Robert J. Morrissey (Liberal \- Egmont, PEI)

![][image9]

Robert (Bobby) Morrissey has served as the Liberal MP for Egmont since 2015 and previously held provincial cabinet roles in Prince Edward Island. His work in Parliament has focused on Veterans Affairs, rural development, and agriculture, with less direct involvement in fisheries or marine conservation files.

Prior to entering politics in 1982, Morrissey was employed in the fishery. Since 2000, he was a consultant specializing in corporate/government relations, fisheries, labor market, and community development. He was also President of PFI Group, President of Global Food Technologies, and Director of Royal Star Investments.

He has generally followed the Liberal line on environmental and economic issues, supporting 30x30 targets and rural infrastructure investment. However, he has kept a low national profile and is seen as a stable, backbench supporter rather than a policy driver on FOPO.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Prioritizes fishery access  
- **Fish Farms:** Defends mussel farming; rejects comparisons to B.C. salmon farms  
- **Licensing:** Protects mussel farming licenses from environmental rules and lobbies for dredging funds  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Strong PEI seafood industry backing

## Voting Record

- ✅ **For** mussel farm subsidies (2023)  
- ❌ **Against** extending the transition period for open-net pen salmon farms in BC (2022)

## Riding Information

**Riding:** Egmont, PEI \- Rural riding encompassing fishing communities (e.g., Tignish, Alberton), reliant on lobster, oyster, and mussel fisheries **Riding Status:** Safe Liberal seat; Morrissey succeeded Joe McGuire (1993–2006; 2015–2021) **Key Industries:** Fishing, aquaculture, tourism **Median Income:** $35,600 **Additional Subcommittees:** Atlantic Caucus (advocates for regional fisheries funding)

## Threat Matrix: Possible Soft Opposition, Atheist

## Key Quotes

"Islanders work closely with DFO to sustain both fish stocks and livelihoods." (2022 statement via CBC PEI)

"The lobster fishery isn't just an industry; it's the backbone of our communities. We'll fight any threats to it, whether from overregulation or climate change." (Speech in Alberton, PEI, September 2021\)

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

Robert Morrissey brings three decades of experience as an RCMP sergeant specializing in rural policing to his political career, cultivating a pragmatic style that avoids partisan grandstanding in favor of localized problem-solving. His focus remains tightly fixed on fisheries issues impacting his Egmont constituents, deliberately sidestepping the national spotlight; a tendency reflected in his subdued media footprint, with coverage largely confined to regional outlets like The Guardian (PEI) and CBC PEI.

**Fisheries Advocacy:**

- Pushed for flexible MPA rules to protect PEI's inshore fishery (FOPO Minutes, 2022\)  
- Opposed unfunded DFO mandates on small harbors (Journal Pioneer, 2022\)

**Climate Change:**

- Highlighted coastal erosion risks to fishing infrastructure (CBC PEI, 2023\)

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Prolific poster. Appears to be actually answering questions himself. Has film footage everywhere, every day that he posts.

- **Facebook:** Primary platform; posts focus on fishery funding announcements, local events and parliamentary business  
- **Twitter/X:** Rarely used; mostly retweets of Liberal policies  
- **Key Post:** "Standing with PEI lobster fishers today; their livelihoods depend on science-based decisions, not politics." (July 2023\)

## Political & Policy Record

He has offered little public media commentary beyond routine statements on Veterans Affairs and small business (reflecting his background). No controversial positions have been reported. His committee participation is modest, focusing on regional PEI concerns.

## Affiliations & Relationships

Morrissey is close to the local Liberal establishment and veterans' organizations (given his RCMP history). He doesn't have high-level national profiles. There is no known involvement with interest groups outside typical Liberal networks.

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

Egmont is a solid seat, so electoral vulnerability is low. Since he lacks a media footprint, weaknesses are hard to identify: no public missteps to exploit. If anything, his reliance on party brand means an opposition could try to link him to unpopular Liberal policies (e.g. carbon tax, pipeline projects) in PEI. But personally, he appears above personal reproach.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**

- **Century-spanning Career May Appear Stale:** First elected provincially in 1982, served until 2000, and federally since 2015\. Critics may argue he's part of the "old guard," resistant to change or new ideas.  
- **Defensive on Liberal Spending & Carbon Pricing:** Frequently defends government's record on carbon pricing and fiscal discipline;positions that split public opinion on PEI. Could be attacked as out of touch economically.  
- **Infrastructure & Energy Messaging Risk Overreach:** Emphasized green infrastructure and energy deals (e.g. Atlantic Energy Loop, wind/solar). Vulnerable if projects falter or are seen as unnecessary spending.  
- **Potential Disconnect from Local Sentiment:** With broad national focus (pandemic recovery, supply management), he may be criticized for missing kitchen-table issues like fishing, ferry costs, or housing.

## Opposition & Critics

Limited opposition due to his low-profile approach and focus on local issues. Potential criticism centers around:

- **Aquaculture Stance:** No public statements on PEI mussel/oyster farming expansion  
- **Indigenous Fisheries:** Limited engagement with Lennox Island First Nation publicly noted

## 10\. Member \- Clifford Small (Conservative — Central Newfoundland, NL)

![Clifford Small][image10]

Before entering politics, he worked in the fishing industry as a harvester and in seafood processing. His background has influenced his focus on commercial fisheries and opposition to policies he views as restrictive to industry, such as marine protected areas (MPAs) and regulations on aquaculture. Small has publicly criticized federal environmental policies, including expanded MPAs and salmon farm closures in British Columbia, arguing they harm rural livelihoods without sufficient scientific justification.

As a member of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans (FOPO), he has advocated for open-net pen aquaculture and resisted catch restrictions tied to conservation goals. His positions align with the Conservative Party's emphasis on resource-sector economic growth over regulatory constraints. He has become a high-profile opponent of MPAs and marine conservation zones, describing them as government overreach threatening Atlantic livelihoods.

Small has opposed the proposed NMCA on Newfoundland's south coast, supports seal culls to protect fish stocks, and is closely aligned with aquaculture and fishery associations. He often casts conservationists as out-of-touch with the realities of working fishers.

## Key Positions

- **MPAs:** Argues MPAs kill rural jobs; demands exemptions for Newfoundland fisheries  
- **Fish Farms:** Champion of Atlantic aquaculture; calls B.C. phase-out "disastrous"  
- **Licensing:** Opposes redistributing crab quotas  
- **Conflicts/Notes:** Former fish plant owner; staunch industry ally

## Voting Record

- ❌ **Against** all MPA designations in Newfoundland (2019–2024)  
- ✅ **For** aquaculture deregulation (2023)  
- ✅ **For** extending offshore oil exploration (2023)  
- ✅ **For** snow crab quota increases (2022, 2023\)

## Riding Information

**Riding Status:** Strong Conservative but only narrow win in 2021 **Demographics:** 78% rural; median income $49,300, high unemployment (12.4% in 2023\) **Fisheries-Dependent:** 1 in 3 jobs tied to Snow Crab ($220M/yr export), Groundfish Revival (Cod/Turbot: 18% employment growth since 2015), Salmon Aquaculture (3 major farms in Fortune Bay) **Additional Subcommittees:** N/A

## Threat Matrix: Strong Opposition, Atheist Accelerationist

## Key Quotes

"DFO should be focused on helping harvesters, not catering to environmental lobbyists." (FOPO Evidence, June 2023\)

"DFO's mandate must prioritize harvesters, not ideological agendas." (X, March 2024\)

"Ottawa's overregulation is killing aquaculture jobs." (2023)

Foreign Influence Question: "Minister, the FFAW, the MFU, the PEIFA, the UFCA and many other fishing industry stakeholders are quite concerned about who is gaining stakeholder status at stock assessments. Do you believe that foreign countries should be able to influence decisions made for Canadian stock assessments? If an ENGO receives a large amount of its funding from foreign sources, is it possible that they might push the agenda of their foreign funders?" (Dec. 4, 2024\)

"Minister, we have ENGOs in stock assessments that constantly want quota cuts, fisheries shut down and fishing areas taken away from fish harvesters, and they're funded by groups outside of Canada. Why are you allowing that to happen?" (Dec. 4, 2024\)

"Marine Protected Areas are just a backdoor to end fishing." (SaltWire, 2022\)

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

Small made national headlines in 2024 with sensational crime claims about his rural Newfoundland riding: he told the House there were "towns of fewer than 1,000 people… where teenage girls are being sold into prostitution" and "crack houses" abound. These shocking statements were proven baseless – the RCMP explicitly said it had "no evidence" of any such incidents. Small's unsupported allegations (e.g. graffiti on an RCMP car, seniors sleeping with bats) have been rebuked by police and local officials. This undermines his credibility: opponents can accuse him of fear-mongering and spreading false information to advance a tough-on-crime agenda (similar to Pierre Poilievre's narrative).

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

He is active on Facebook and Instagram mainly to promote local events. Small's social posts often echo Poilievre's messaging (e.g. anti-Carbon Tax, anti-Bill C-5, and crime rhetoric). The IndyNFO and local media have archived his controversial speeches; excerpts from parliament debates are easily accessible. His digital history lacks any serious scandals, but his posts emphasize Law & Order slogans that feed into national "crime wave" tropes.

- **Twitter/X:** @CliffordSmallMP  
- **Facebook:** facebook.com/CliffordSmallMP

## Political & Policy Record

First elected in 2021, Small has aligned strongly with his leader's agenda. He backed Conservative bills to toughen bail laws, mandatory minimums, and cut social spending. He opposes any liberalization of cannabis or drug laws, consistent with his rhetoric. Small has also pressed for resource development in NL (e.g. opposition to offshore development pauses). Notable votes include supporting Bill C-15 (stiffer conditional release rules) and opposing drug decriminalization expansions.

**Characteristics:** Rural Populist: Channels anger over DFO policies into Conservative wins (68% vote share); Climate Skeptic: Dismisses ocean warming threats despite riding's erosion crisis

## Affiliations & Relationships

Strong alignment with Conservative leadership and resource industry stakeholders. Closely allied with aquaculture and fishery associations across Atlantic Canada.

## First Nations Territory

**Territory:** There are no active First Nations or current chiefs/councils. The Beothuk were historically present but are now extinct, and while the Mi'kmaq have broader traditional ties to Newfoundland, there are no recognized Mi'kmaq reserves or governing councils in this specific electoral district.

## Reputation & Vulnerabilities

Clifford Small is widely seen as amplifying exaggerated crime fears. The RCMP's public rejection of his claims gives the opposition a ready counter-narrative: he exaggerates or fabricates threats. Local officials (mayors) have quietly called out his scaremongering, which can be highlighted. Apart from the crime controversy, Small has no known personal scandals, but his reliability is tarnished by this episode.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**

- **Hypocrisy on Foreign Ownership:** Voted against 2022 motion to ban foreign quota control (FOPO Vote \#127); Accepted $14,800 from Ocean Choice International (Chinese-partnered) in 2023  
- **Aquaculture Double Standard:** NL Farms: Calls salmon farming "essential" (secured $6M for Fortune Bay expansion); BC Farms: Labeled same tech "risky" in 2023 FOPO debates  
- **Science Denial:** Crab Stocks: Claimed "record biomass" during 2024 quota cuts (contradicting DFO Science)  
- **Labour Betrayals:** 2023 Strike: Called crab pickers' wage demands "unrealistic" during 23-day walkout; FFAW Leak: Email showed Small prioritizing "processor margins" over harvester shares

## Opposition & Critics

**Fear-Based Rhetoric & Overreach:** His appeal to "terrified seniors" and tales of rampant crime may resonate locally but critics argue he's exaggerating fear to drive political gain

**False Crime Claims & Credibility:** On Sept 26, 2024, Small claimed in the House that small towns in his riding were overrun with "five crack houses" where teenage girls were being sold into prostitution, and seniors were being threatened. The RCMP publicly refuted his claims, stating they had no records of child trafficking, crack houses, or vandalized police cars in those communities.
