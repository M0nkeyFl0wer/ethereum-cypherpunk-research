<span style="background-color: #90EE90">Patrick Weiler, born in 1986</span> ✅ [[Confirmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Weiler)], <span style="background-color: #90EE90">is a trained environmental and natural resource management lawyer (J.D., UBC; B.A., McGill)</span> ✅ [[Confirmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Weiler)]. His legal career focused on environmental and aboriginal law. His work included collaboration at the United Nations to improve the management of aquatic ecosystems. <span style="background-color: #90EE90">Elected in 2019 and re-elected in 2021 and 2025</span> ✅ [[Confirmed](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/patrick-weiler(105918))]. He has worked with First Nations, governments, and international organizations on aquatic ecosystem governance and sustainability. As an MP, he has become one of the strongest Liberal voices for ocean protection.

Weiler supported the creation of Canada's largest Marine Protected Area in 2024 (~133,000 km² off BC's coast) and consistently backs the federal 30x30 target. He has advocated for science-based marine conservation that incorporates Indigenous governance. Environmental organizations such as the David Suzuki Foundation frequently consult him on MPA strategy. He is expected to strongly support the Great Bear Sea MPA network, provided it upholds consultation and long-term ecosystem integrity.

## Key Quotes

<span style="background-color: #FFD700">"We are fully committed to protecting wild pacific salmon and the work needed to reverse the current declines. Although I was disappointed that the DFO report in September did not include further analysis of the cumulative risk of all nine pathogens taken together independently or in conjunction with other cumulative risks to wild salmon such as sea lice, climate change, or overharvesting, this decision reaffirms my strong belief that we are on the right path."

## Public Statements & Media Analysis

Weiler, as FOPO Chair, projects an image of a moderate Liberal with environmentalist credentials (he's a former environmental lawyer). He has touted housing, climate adaptation, and Indigenous relations in local media. However, he has also publicly challenged his own party leadership. In late 2024 he argued that Prime Minister Trudeau "does not have the support of a significant amount of his caucus" and "should resign". These statements expose internal Liberal divisions and could be used to question his loyalty and consistency.

## Social Media & Digital Footprint

Weiler is active on Twitter and Instagram with mostly positive local content (community events, announcements). A notable digital posture is his endorsement of Mark Carney in the 2025 Liberal leadership race. Opponents might note his support for younger voter-friendly initiatives like lowering the voting age to 16, appealing to some but potentially seen as extreme by others. He generally avoids personal controversies online.

## Political & Policy Record

<span style="background-color: #90EE90">He was elected in 2019 and re-elected with growing margins</span> ✅ [[Confirmed](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/patrick-weiler(105918))]. Policy-wise, Weiler has emphasized environmental protection: he defended carbon pricing and climate action in his riding. He sponsored water infrastructure and Indigenous partnership projects in BC. His committee work includes climate change and indigenous affairs, but FOPO as Chair is his primary role. He has also backed electoral reform (Bill C-210) and an immediate Gaza ceasefire, positions not universally popular.
