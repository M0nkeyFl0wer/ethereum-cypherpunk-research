## FABRICATIONS DETECTED & CORRECTED

### 1. Patrick Weiler - Bill C-55 Vote ❌

**Location:** Line 24

**Fabrication:**
> "✅ **For** Bill C-55 (2019, expanded MPA designations)"

**Evidence:**
- Bill C-55 received Royal Assent: **May 27, 2019**
- Patrick Weiler elected to Parliament: **October 21, 2019**
- **Timeline gap:** 147 days (nearly 5 months)

**Conclusion:** ❌ **IMPOSSIBLE** - Cannot vote on bill that passed before election

**Source:** [OpenParliament - Bill C-55](https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/C-55/), [Wikipedia - Patrick Weiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Weiler)

**Action:** **DELETE this claim** from document
