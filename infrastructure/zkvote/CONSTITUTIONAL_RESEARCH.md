# Zkvote

zkVote (zkVot Protocol) is a client-side trustless distributed computation protocol utilizing zero-knowledge proving technology for anonymous and censorship-resistant voting while ensuring scalability. It is one of the first complete implementations of a fully censorship-resistant anonymous voting application that can scale to a meaningful number of voters. The protocol allows voters to maintain anonymity while the system verifies vote authenticity, preventing double-voting and tampering through blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs.
