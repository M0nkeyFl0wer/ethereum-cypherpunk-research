# Findora

Findora is a public layer-1 blockchain with programmable privacy and EVM compatibility, utilizing the latest breakthroughs in zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation to allow users transactional privacy with selective auditability. It features a dual-chain architecture that creates a zk-ledger rather than a purely open ledger, combining EVM for programmability and UTXO for privacy. Findora's confidential transfers use Bulletproofs-based cryptography to mask transaction amounts and asset types.
