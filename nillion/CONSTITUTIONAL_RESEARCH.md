# Nillion

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high value data, building humanity's first 'blind computer'. The network enables blind computing through coordination of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) such as multi-party computation (MPC), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and zero-knowledge proofs. Users store and process data in the network by masking it with preprocessed blinding factors, generating Information-Theoretic Secure (ITS) particles. This allows for the creation of an ecosystem of applications co-operating without having to reveal sensitive information.
