# Starkex

StarkEx is a Layer 2 scalability engine for Ethereum that uses STARK (Scalable, Transparent ARgument of Knowledge) zero-knowledge proofs to provide high throughput and low gas fees without compromising security or self-custody. It processes batched transactions with validity proofs, supporting NFT trading, derivatives, AMM, spot trading, and DeFi applications. While the underlying STARK technology has privacy capabilities, StarkEx currently does not enable zero-knowledge privacy features.
