## Next Steps for Research-Required Projects

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Basic Data Collection** (788 projects)
   - Find official website
   - Locate GitHub repository
   - Get project description
   - Verify privacy focus

2. **Verification** (788 projects)
   - Confirm project is active
   - Validate privacy claims
   - Check if truly Web3-related

3. **Comprehensive Research** (after basics complete)
   - CODE_REVIEW.md (GitHub analysis)
   - TEAM.md (leadership verification)
   - SECURITY.md (privacy features, audits)
   - TECHNICAL.md (architecture, capabilities)

## Research Methodology

All projects will follow our "constitutional research" methodology:
- **Multi-source verification** - Cross-reference multiple sources
- **No fabrication** - Only verified data included
- **Honest gaps** - Document what we don't know
- **Confidence scoring** - Rate data quality (0.0-1.0)
- **Community collaboration** - Invite corrections

---

## Timeline Estimates

**Conservative estimates for 788 projects:**

### Phase 1: Basic Data (3-6 months)
- 5-10 projects per day
- ~80-160 days of active research
- Focus on finding websites, repos, descriptions

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Research (6-12 months)
- ~200 projects will have sufficient data
- Same depth as current 40 deliverables
- CODE_REVIEW, TEAM, SECURITY, TECHNICAL reports

### Phase 3: Ongoing Maintenance (continuous)
- Regular updates as projects evolve
- Security advisory monitoring
- Community corrections

---

## Automation Potential

**Agent Swarms Can Accelerate:**
- Web searches for official sources (fully automated)
- GitHub API analysis (fully automated)
- Basic README generation (semi-automated)

**Requires Human Review:**
- Privacy claims validation
- Team verification
- Security assessment accuracy
- Data quality spot-checks

---

## Community Contribution Opportunities

**High-Value Contributions:**
1. **Submit basic info** for projects you know
2. **Verify privacy claims** where you have expertise
3. **Update outdated data** as projects evolve
4. **Tag projects** you're involved with

**How to Help:**
- Browse research-required/ folder
- Pick projects you're familiar with
- Submit PRs with basic info (website, GitHub, description)
- Open issues to flag non-privacy projects
