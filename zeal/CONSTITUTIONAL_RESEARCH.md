# Zeal

Zeal is a self-custody Web3 wallet built as a Smart Wallet with Gnosis Safe, protected by biometric authentication instead of seed phrases. It features a Privacy Shield that removes user information from transactions to prevent blockchain nodes from tracking IP addresses. Users can manage assets across Solana, Ethereum, and 50+ EVM chains, earn 6% APY through DeFi protocols like Sky and Aave, and spend crypto directly via a self-custodial Visa card at 3+ million merchants worldwide.
