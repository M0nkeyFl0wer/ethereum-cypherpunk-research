Subject: Help Us Complete Your Project's Research Profile

Hello [PROJECT_NAME] team,

We're conducting comprehensive privacy-focused Web3 research and have documented your project in our Ethereum Cypherpunk Research dataset:
https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/ethereum-cypherpunk-research

We've analyzed your code, architecture, and privacy features, but we're missing some blockchain deployment data. We document where we searched and couldn't find data, rather than fabricating information.

**What we're looking for:**
- Smart contract addresses (if deployed)
- Network/chain information
- Any public blockchain metrics you'd like to share
- Verification of our current research findings

**Your research page:**
https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/ethereum-cypherpunk-research/tree/main/[CATEGORY]/[PROJECT]

**How to contribute:**
1. Review your project page
2. Submit corrections/additions via Pull Request: https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/ethereum-cypherpunk-research/pulls
3. Or open an issue: https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/ethereum-cypherpunk-research/issues

We believe in transparent research and community collaboration. Your input will help create the most accurate privacy-focused Web3 dataset available.

Thank you for your work on privacy technology!

Best regards,
Web3 Privacy Research Team
